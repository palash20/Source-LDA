A submarine (or simply sub) watercraft capable independent operation underwater. It differs submersible, limited underwater capability. The term commonly refers large, crewed vessel. It historically colloquially refer remotely operated vehicles robots, well medium-sized smaller vessels, midget submarine wet sub. The submarine evolved shortened submarine boat; naval tradition, submarines referred "boats" "ships", size.Although experimental submarines built before, submarine design 19th century, navies. Submarines World War I (1914–1918), figure navies small. Military usage includes attacking enemy surface ships (merchant military), attacking submarines, aircraft carrier protection, blockade running, ballistic missile submarines nuclear strike force, reconnaissance, conventional land attack (for example cruise missile), covert insertion forces. Civilian submarines include marine science, salvage, exploration facility inspection maintenance. Submarines modified perform specialized functions search-and-rescue missions undersea cable repair. Submarines tourism, undersea archaeology.Most submarines consist cylindrical hemispherical (or conical) vertical structure, located amidships, houses communications sensing devices well periscopes. In modern submarines, structure "sail" American usage, "fin" European usage. A "conning tower" feature earlier designs: separate pressure hull boat allowed shorter periscopes. There propeller (or pump jet) rear, hydrodynamic control fins. Smaller, deep-diving specialty submarines deviate traditional layout. Submarines diving planes change amount water air ballast tanks change buoyancy submerging surfacing.Submarines widest ranges types capabilities vessel. They range small autonomous examples one- two-person vessels operate hours, vessels remain submerged months—such Russian Typhoon class, biggest submarines built. Submarines work greater depths survivable practical human divers. Modern deep-diving submarines derive bathyscaphe, turn evolved diving bell. History Early submersibles According report Opusculum Taisnieri published 1562:Two Greeks submerged surfaced river Tagus City Toledo presence The Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, wet flame carried hands alight.In 1578, English mathematician William Bourne recorded book Inventions Devises plans underwater navigation vehicle. A years Scottish mathematician theologian John Napier wrote Secret Inventions (1596) following: "These inventions devises sayling water divers, devises strategems harming enemyes Grace God worke expert Craftsmen I hope perform." It's unclear carried idea.The submersible construction exists reliable designed built 1620 Cornelis Drebbel, Dutchman service James I England. It propelled oars. 18th century submarines By mid-18th century, dozen patents submarines/submersible boats granted England. In 1747, Nathaniel Symons patented built working example ballast tank submersion. His design leather bags fill water submerge craft. A mechanism twist water bags boat resurface. In 1749, Gentlemen's Magazine reported design initially proposed Giovanni Borelli 1680. By point development, improvement design stagnated century, industrial technologies propulsion stability applied.The military submarine Turtle (1775), hand-powered acorn-shaped device designed American David Bushnell accommodate single person. It verified submarine capable independent underwater operation movement, screws propulsion. 19th century submarines In 1800, France built human-powered submarine designed American Robert Fulton, Nautilus. The French eventually experiment 1804, British considered Fulton's submarine design.In 1864, American Civil War, Confederate navy's H. L. Hunley military submarine sink enemy vessel, Union sloop-of-war USS Housatonic. In aftermath attack ship, Hunley sank, close exploding torpedo.In 1866, submarine dived controlled underwater cruise emerged surface Sub Marine Explorer German American Julius H. Kroehl (in German, Kröhl), incorporated technologies essential modern submarines. Mechanical power The submarine relying human power propulsion French Plongeur (Diver), launched 1863, compressed air 180 psi (1241 kPa).

The Nordenfelt I, 56-tonne, 19.5-metre (64 ft) vessel Garret's ill-fated Resurgam (1879), range 240 kilometres (130 nmi; 150 mi), armed single torpedo, 1885.A reliable propulsion submerged vessel 1880s advent electric battery technology. The electrically powered boats built Isaac Peral Caballero Spain, Dupuy Lôme Gustave Zédé France, James Franklin Waddington England. 20th century submarines Submarines service widespread routine navies 1900s. This marked pivotal submarine development, technologies appeared. A number nations built submarines. Diesel electric propulsion power system equipment periscope standardized. Countries conducted experiments effective tactics weapons submarines, led impact World War I.The Irish inventor John Philip Holland built model submarine 1876 full-scale version 1878, number unsuccessful ones. In 1896 designed Holland Type VI submarine, internal combustion engine power surface electric battery power underwater. Launched 17 May 1897 Navy Lt. Lewis Nixon's Crescent Shipyard Elizabeth, New Jersey, Holland VI purchased United States Navy 11 April 1900, Navy's commissioned submarine, christened USS Holland.Commissioned June 1900, French steam electric Narval employed typical double-hull design, pressure hull inside outer shell.

Due blockade Port Arthur, Russians submarines Vladivostok, 1 January 1905 boats, create world's "operational submarine fleet". The submarine fleet began patrols 14 February, lasting 24 hours each. The confrontation Japanese warships occurred 29 April 1905 Russian submarine Som fired Japanese torpedo boats, withdrew. World War I Military submarines impact World War I. Forces U-boats Germany action First Battle Atlantic, responsible sinking RMS Lusitania, sunk unrestricted submarine warfare cited reasons entry United States war.At outbreak Germany 20 submarines combat, included vessels diesel-engined U-19 class range (5,000 miles) speed (eight knots) operate effectively entire British coast. By contrast Royal Navy total 74 submarines, mixed effectiveness. In August 1914, flotilla U-boats sailed base Heligoland attack Royal Navy warships North Sea submarine patrol history.The U-boats' ability function practical machines relied tactics, numbers, submarine technologies combination diesel-electric power system developed preceding years. More submersibles true submarines, U-boats operated surface regular engines, submerging occasionally attack battery power. They roughly triangular cross-section, distinct keel control rolling surfaced, distinct bow. During World War I 5,000 Allied ships sunk U-boats. World War II During World War II, Germany submarines devastating Battle Atlantic, attempted cut Britain's supply routes sinking merchant ships Britain replace. (Shipping vital supply Britain's population food, industry raw material, armed forces fuel armaments.) While U-boats destroyed number ships, strategy ultimately failed. Although U-boats updated interwar years, major innovation improved communications, encrypted famous Enigma cipher machine. This allowed mass-attack naval tactics (Rudeltaktik, commonly "wolfpack"), ultimately U-boats' downfall. By war, 3,000 Allied ships (175 warships, 2,825 merchantmen) sunk U-boats. Although war, ultimately U-boat fleet suffered casualty rate 73%, fatalities.The Imperial Japanese Navy operated varied fleet submarines navy, including Kaiten crewed torpedoes, midget submarines (Type A Ko-hyoteki Kairyu classes), medium-range submarines, purpose-built supply submarines long-range fleet submarines. They submarines highest submerged speeds World War II (I-201-class submarines) submarines carry multiple aircraft (I-400-class submarines). They equipped advanced torpedoes conflict, oxygen-propelled Type 95. Nevertheless, despite technical prowess, Japan chose utilize submarines fleet warfare, consequently unsuccessful, warships fast, maneuverable well-defended compared merchant ships.The submarine force effective anti-ship weapon American arsenal. Submarines, 2 percent U.S. Navy, destroyed 30 percent Japanese Navy, including 8 aircraft carriers, 1 battleship 11 cruisers. US submarines destroyed 60 percent Japanese merchant fleet, crippling Japan's ability supply military forces industrial effort. Allied submarines Pacific War destroyed Japanese shipping weapons combined. This feat considerably aided Imperial Japanese Navy's failure adequate escort forces nation's merchant fleet.During World War II, 314 submarines served US Navy, 260 deployed Pacific. When Japanese attacked Hawaii December 1941, 111 boats commission; 203 submarines Gato, Balao, Tench classes commissioned war. During war, 52 US submarines lost causes, 48 directly hostilities. US submarines sank 1,560 enemy vessels, total tonnage 5.3 tons (55% total sunk).The Royal Navy Submarine Service classic Axis blockade. Its major operating areas Norway, Mediterranean (against Axis supply routes North Africa), Far East. In war, British submarines sank 2 tons enemy shipping 57 major warships, including 35 submarines. Among documented instance submarine sinking submarine submerged. This occurred HMS Venturer engaged U864; Venturer crew manually computed firing solution three-dimensionally maneuvering target techniques basis modern torpedo computer targeting systems. Seventy-four British submarines lost, majority, 42, Mediterranean. Cold-War military models The launch cruise missile (SSM-N-8 Regulus) submarine occurred July 1953, deck USS Tunny, World War II fleet boat modified carry missile nuclear warhead. Tunny sister boat, Barbero, United States' nuclear deterrent patrol submarines. In 1950s, nuclear power partially replaced diesel-electric propulsion. Equipment developed extract oxygen water. These innovations submarines ability remain submerged weeks months. Most naval submarines built US, Soviet Union/Russian Federation, Britain, France powered nuclear reactors.In 1959–1960, ballistic missile submarines service United States (George Washington class) Soviet Union (Golf class) Cold War nuclear deterrent strategy.During Cold War, US Soviet Union maintained submarine fleets engaged cat-and-mouse games. The Soviet Union lost submarines period: K-129 lost 1968 (a CIA retrieved ocean floor Howard Hughes-designed ship Glomar Explorer), K-8 1970, K-219 1986, Komsomolets 1989 (which held depth record military submarines—1000 m). Many Soviet subs, K-19 (the Soviet nuclear submarine, Soviet reach North Pole) badly damaged fire radiation leaks. The US lost nuclear submarines time: USS Thresher equipment failure test dive operational limit, USS Scorpion unknown causes.During Indo-Pakistani War 1971, Pakistan Navy's Hangor sank Indian frigate INS Khukri. This sinking submarine World War II. During war, Ghazi, Tench-class submarine loan Pakistan US, sunk. It submarine combat loss World War II. In 1982 Falklands War, Argentine cruiser General Belgrano sunk British submarine HMS Conqueror, sinking nuclear-powered submarine war. 21st century submarines Usage Military Before World War II, primary role submarine anti-surface ship warfare. Submarines attack surface, deck guns submerged, torpedoes. They effective sinking Allied transatlantic shipping World Wars, disrupting Japanese supply routes naval operations Pacific World War II.Mine-laying submarines developed 20th century. The facility World Wars. Submarines inserting removing covert agents military forces, intelligence gathering, rescue aircrew air attacks islands, airmen told safe places crash-land submarines rescue them. Submarines carry cargo hostile waters supply vessels submarines.Submarines locate attack submarines surface, HMS Venturer managed sink U-864 torpedo spread submerged. The British developed specialized anti-submarine submarine WWI, R class. After WWII, development homing torpedo, better sonar systems, nuclear propulsion, submarines hunt effectively.The development submarine-launched ballistic missile submarine-launched cruise missiles submarines long-ranged ability attack land targets variety weapons ranging cluster bombs nuclear weapons.The primary defense submarine lies ability remain concealed depths ocean. Early submarines detected sound made. Water excellent conductor sound (much better air), submarines detect track comparatively noisy surface ships distances. Modern submarines built emphasis stealth. Advanced propeller designs, extensive sound-reducing insulation, machinery help submarine remain quiet ambient ocean noise, making difficult detect. It takes specialized technology find attack modern submarines.Active sonar reflection sound emitted equipment detect submarines. It WWII surface ships, submarines aircraft (via dropped buoys helicopter "dipping" arrays), reveals emitter's position, susceptible counter-measures.A concealed military submarine threat, stealth, force enemy navy waste resources searching areas ocean protecting ships attack. This advantage vividly demonstrated 1982 Falklands War British nuclear-powered submarine HMS Conqueror sank Argentine cruiser General Belgrano. After sinking Argentine Navy recognized effective defense submarine attack, Argentine surface fleet withdrew remainder war, Argentine submarine remained sea. Civilian Although majority world's submarines military, civilian submarines, tourism, exploration, oil gas platform inspections, pipeline surveys. Some illegal activities.The Submarine Voyage ride opened Disneyland 1959, water true submarine, tracks open atmosphere. The tourist submarine Auguste Piccard, service 1964 Expo64. By 1997 45 tourist submarines operating world. Submarines crush depth range 400–500 feet (120–150 m) operated areas worldwide, typically bottom depths 100 120 feet (30 37 m), carrying capacity 50 100 passengers.In typical operation surface vessel carries passengers offshore operating area loads submarine. The submarine visits underwater points interest natural artificial reef structures. To surface safely danger collision location submarine marked air release movement surface coordinated observer support craft.A development deployment so-called narco submarines South American drug smugglers evade law enforcement detection. Although occasionally deploy true submarines, self-propelled semi-submersibles, portion craft remains water times. In September 2011, Colombian authorities seized 16-meter-long submersible hold crew 5, costing $2 million. The vessel belonged FARC rebels capacity carry 7 tonnes drugs.

Technology Submersion trimming All surface ships, well surfaced submarines, positively buoyant condition, weighing volume water displace submerged. To submerge hydrostatically, ship negative buoyancy, increasing weight decreasing displacement water. To control displacement, submarines ballast tanks, hold varying amounts water air.For general submersion surfacing, submarines forward tanks, called Main Ballast Tanks (MBT), filled water submerge air surface. Submerged, MBTs generally remain flooded, simplifies design, submarines tanks interhull space. For precise control depth, submarines smaller Depth Control Tanks (DCT) – called tanks (due ability withstand higher pressure), trim tanks. The amount water depth control tanks controlled change depth maintain constant depth conditions (chiefly water density) change. Depth control tanks located submarine's center gravity, separated submarine prevent trim.When submerged, water pressure submarine's hull reach 4 MPa (580 psi) steel submarines 10 MPa (1,500 psi) titanium submarines K-278 Komsomolets, interior pressure remains unchanged. This difference hull compression, decreases displacement. Water density marginally increases depth, salinity pressure higher. This change density incompletely compensates hull compression, buoyancy decreases depth increases. A submerged submarine unstable equilibrium, tendency sink float surface. Keeping constant depth requires continual operation depth control tanks control surfaces.Submarines neutral buoyancy condition intrinsically trim-stable. To maintain desired trim, submarines forward trim tanks. Pumps move water tanks, changing weight distribution pointing down. A system maintain stability.The hydrostatic variable ballast tanks control submarine underwater. Hydrodynamic maneuvering surfaces, moved create hydrodynamic forces submarine moves speed. The stern planes, located propeller horizontal, serve purpose trim tanks, controlling trim, commonly used, control surfaces submarines. The fairwater planes sail and/or bow planes body, horizontal, closer center gravity, control depth trim.When submarine performs emergency surfacing, depth trim methods simultaneously, propelling boat upwards. Such surfacing quick, partially jump water, damaging submarine systems. Hull Overview Modern submarines cigar-shaped. This design, visible submarines called "teardrop hull". It reduces hydrodynamic drag submerged, decreases sea-keeping capabilities increases drag surfaced. Since limitations propulsion systems submarines forced operate surfaced time, hull designs compromise. Because slow submerged speeds subs, well 10 kt (18 km/h), increased drag underwater travel acceptable. Late World War II, technology allowed faster longer submerged operation increased aircraft surveillance forced submarines stay submerged, hull designs teardrop shaped reduce drag noise. USS Albacore (AGSS-569) unique submarine pioneered American version teardrop hull (sometimes referred "Albacore hull") modern submarines. On modern military submarines outer hull covered layer sound-absorbing rubber, anechoic plating, reduce detection.The occupied pressure hulls deep diving submarines DSV Alvin spherical cylindrical. This allows distribution stress great depth. A titanium frame affixed pressure hull, providing attachment ballast trim systems, scientific instrumentation, battery packs, syntactic flotation foam, lighting.A raised tower submarine accommodates periscope electronics masts, include radio, radar, electronic warfare, systems including snorkel mast. In classes submarines (see history), control room, "conn", located inside tower, "conning tower". Since then, conn located hull submarine, tower called "sail". The conn distinct "bridge", small open platform sail, observation surface operation."Bathtubs" conning towers smaller submarines. The bathtub metal cylinder surrounding hatch prevents waves breaking directly cabin. It needed surfaced submarines limited freeboard, is, water. Bathtubs help prevent swamping vessel. Single double hulls Modern submarines submersibles, well oldest ones, single hull. Large submarines generally additional hull hull sections outside. This external hull, forms shape submarine, called outer hull (casing Royal Navy) hull, withstand pressure difference. Inside outer hull hull, pressure hull, withstands pressure atmospheric pressure inside.As World War I, realized optimal shape withstanding pressure conflicted optimal shape seakeeping minimal drag, construction difficulties complicated problem. This solved compromise shape, hulls; internal holding pressure, external optimal shape. Until World War II, submarines additional partial cover top, bow stern, built thinner metal, flooded submerged. Germany Type XXI, general predecessor modern submarines, pressure hull enclosed inside hull, optimized submerged navigation, earlier designs optimized surface operation.After World War II, approaches split. The Soviet Union changed designs, basing German developments. All post–World War II heavy Soviet Russian submarines built double hull structure. American Western submarines switched single-hull approach. They hull sections bow stern, house ballast tanks hydrodynamically optimized shape, cylindrical hull single plating layer. Double hulls considered future submarines United States improve payload capacity, stealth range. Pressure hull The pressure hull generally constructed thick high-strength steel complex structure high strength reserve, separated watertight bulkheads compartments. There examples hulls submarine, Typhoon class, pressure hulls three smaller control room, torpedoes steering gear, missile launch system hulls.The dive depth increased easily. Simply making hull thicker increases weight requires reduction onboard equipment weight, ultimately bathyscaphe. This acceptable civilian submersibles, military submarines.WWI submarines hulls carbon steel, 100-metre (330 ft) maximum depth. During WWII, high-strength alloyed steel introduced, allowing 200-metre (660 ft) depths. High-strength alloy steel remains primary material submarines today, 250–400-metre (820–1,310 ft) depths, exceeded military submarine design compromises. To exceed limit, submarines built titanium hulls. Titanium stronger steel, lighter, ferromagnetic, stealth. Titanium submarines built Soviet Union, developed specialized high-strength alloys. It produced types titanium submarines. Titanium alloys allow major increase depth, systems redesigned cope, test depth limited 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) Soviet submarine K-278 Komsomolets, deepest-diving combat submarine. An Alfa-class submarine operated 1,300 metres (4,300 ft), continuous operation depths produce excessive stress submarine systems. Titanium flex steel, brittle dive cycles. Despite benefits, high cost titanium construction led abandonment titanium submarine construction Cold War ended. Deep–diving civilian submarines thick acrylic pressure hulls.The deepest deep-submergence vehicle (DSV) Trieste. On 5 October 1959, Trieste departed San Diego Guam aboard freighter Santa Maria participate Project Nekton, series deep dives Mariana Trench. On 23 January 1960, Trieste reached ocean floor Challenger Deep (the deepest southern Mariana Trench), carrying Jacques Piccard (son Auguste) Lieutenant Don Walsh, USN. This vessel, manned unmanned, reached deepest point Earth's oceans. The onboard systems indicated depth 11,521 metres (37,799 ft), revised 10,916 metres (35,814 ft) accurate measurements 1995 Challenger Deep shallower, 10,911 metres (35,797 ft).Building pressure hull difficult, withstand pressures required diving depth. When hull perfectly cross-section, pressure evenly distributed, hull compression. If shape perfect, hull bent, points heavily strained. Inevitable minor deviations resisted stiffener rings, one-inch (25 mm) deviation roundness 30 percent decrease maximal hydrostatic load consequently dive depth. The hull constructed high precision. All hull parts welded defects, joints checked multiple methods, contributing high cost modern submarines. (For example, Virginia-class attack submarine costs US$2.6 billion, US$200,000 ton displacement.) Propulsion The submarines propelled humans. The mechanically driven submarine 1863 French Plongeur, compressed air propulsion. Anaerobic propulsion employed Spanish Ictineo II 1864, solution zinc, manganese dioxide, potassium chlorate generate heat power steam engine, providing oxygen crew. A system employed 1940 German Navy tested hydrogen peroxide-based system, Walter turbine, experimental V-80 submarine naval U-791 type XVII submarines.Until advent nuclear marine propulsion, 20th-century submarines batteries running underwater gasoline (petrol) diesel engines surface, battery recharging. Early submarines gasoline, kerosene (paraffin), diesel, reduced flammability. Diesel-electric standard propulsion. The diesel gasoline engine electric motor, separated clutches, initially shaft driving propeller. This allowed engine drive electric motor generator recharge batteries propel submarine. The clutch motor engine disengaged submarine dived, motor drive propeller. The motor multiple armatures shaft, electrically coupled series slow speed parallel high speed (these connections called "group down" "group up", respectively). Electric Diesel-electric Early submarines direct mechanical connection engine propeller, switching diesel engines surface running, battery-driven electric motors submerged propulsion.In 1928, United States Navy's Bureau Engineering proposed diesel-electric transmission. Instead driving propeller directly running surface, submarine's diesel drove generator charge submarine's batteries drive electric motor. This electric motor speed independent diesel engine speed, diesel optimum non-critical speed. One diesel engines shut maintenance submarine continued remaining engine battery power. The US pioneered concept 1929, S-class submarines S-3, S-6, S-7. The production submarines system Porpoise-class 1930s, subsequent US diesel submarines 1960s. No navy system 1945, apart Royal Navy's U-class submarines, submarines Imperial Japanese Navy separate diesel generators speed running.Other advantages arrangement submarine travel slowly engines power recharge batteries quickly, reducing surface snorkel. It isolate noisy diesel engines pressure hull, making submarine quieter. Additionally, diesel-electric transmissions compact.During World War II Germans experimented idea schnorchel (snorkel) captured Dutch submarines, war. The schnorchel retractable pipe supplied air diesel engines submerged periscope depth, allowing boats cruise recharge batteries maintaining degree stealth. It perfect solution, however. There problems device's valve sticking shut closing dunked weather; system entire pressure hull buffer, diesels instantaneously suck huge volumes air boat's compartments, crew suffered painful injuries. Speed limited 8 knots (15 km/h), device snap stress. The schnorchel making boat essentially noisy deaf sonar terms. Finally, Allied radar eventually advanced schnorchel mast detected visual range.While snorkel renders submarine detectable, perfect. In clear weather, diesel exhaust surface distance three miles, 'periscope feather' (the wave created snorkel periscope moving water), visible calm conditions. Modern radar capable detecting snorkel calm conditions.The problem diesels causing vacuum submarine head valve submerged exists model diesel submarines, mitigated high-vacuum cut-off sensors shut engines vacuum ship reaches pre-set point. Modern snorkel induction masts fail-safe design compressed air, controlled simple electrical circuit, hold "head valve" open pull powerful spring. Seawater washing mast shorts exposed electrodes top, breaking control, shutting "head valve" submerged. Air-independent propulsion During World War II, German Type XXI submarines (also "Elektroboote") submarines designed operate submerged extended periods. Initially carry hydrogen peroxide long-term, fast air-independent propulsion, ultimately built batteries instead. At War, British Soviets experimented hydrogen peroxide/kerosene (paraffin) engines surfaced submerged. The encouraging. Though Soviet Union deployed class submarines engine type (codenamed Quebec NATO), considered unsuccessful.The United States hydrogen peroxide experimental midget submarine, X-1. It originally powered hydrogen peroxide/diesel engine battery system explosion hydrogen peroxide supply 20 May 1957. X-1 converted diesel-electric drive.Today navies air-independent propulsion. Notably Sweden Stirling technology Gotland-class Södermanland-class submarines. The Stirling engine heated burning diesel fuel liquid oxygen cryogenic tanks. A newer development air-independent propulsion hydrogen fuel cells, German Type 212 submarine, 34 kW 120 kW cells Spanish S-80-class submarines. Nuclear power Steam power resurrected 1950s nuclear-powered steam turbine driving generator. By eliminating atmospheric oxygen, submarine remain submerged limited food stores, breathing air recycled fresh water distilled seawater. More importantly, nuclear submarine unlimited range speed. This allows travel operating base combat zone shorter difficult target anti-submarine weapons. Nuclear-powered submarines small battery diesel engine/generator powerplant emergency reactors shut down.Nuclear power submarines, high cost size nuclear reactors, smaller submarines diesel-electric propulsion. The ratio larger smaller submarines depends strategic needs. The US Navy, French Navy, British Royal Navy operate nuclear submarines, explained distant operations. Other major operators mix nuclear submarines strategic purposes diesel-electric submarines defense. Most fleets nuclear submarines, limited availability nuclear power submarine technology.Diesel-electric submarines stealth advantage nuclear counterparts. Nuclear submarines generate noise coolant pumps turbo-machinery needed operate reactor, power levels. Some nuclear submarines American Ohio class operate reactor coolant pumps secured, making quieter electric subs. A conventional submarine operating batteries completely silent, noise shaft bearings, propeller, flow noise hull, stops hovers mid-water listen, leaving noise crew activity. Commercial submarines batteries, operate conjunction mother ship.Several serious nuclear radiation accidents involved nuclear submarine mishaps. The Soviet submarine K-19 reactor accident 1961 8 deaths 30 people over-exposed radiation. The Soviet submarine K-27 reactor accident 1968 9 fatalities 83 injuries. The Soviet submarine K-431 accident 1985 10 fatalities 49 radiation injuries. Alternative propulsion Oil-fired steam turbines powered British K-class submarines, built World War I later, surface speed battle fleet. The K-class successful, however.Toward 20th century, submarines—such British Vanguard class—began fitted pump-jet propulsors propellers. Though heavier, expensive, efficient propeller, quieter, providing tactical advantage.Magnetohydrodynamic drive (MHD) portrayed operating principle titular submarine's silent propulsion system film adaptation The Hunt Red October. However, novel Red October MHD, above-mentioned pump-jet. Armament The submarine inextricably linked development torpedo, invented Robert Whitehead 1866. His essentially 140 years ago. Only self-propelled torpedoes submarine leap novelty weapon war. Until perfection guided torpedo, multiple "straight-running" torpedoes required attack target. With 20 25 torpedoes stored board, number attacks limited. To increase combat endurance World War I submarines functioned submersible gunboats, deck guns unarmed targets, diving escape engage enemy warships. The guns encouraged development unsuccessful Submarine Cruiser French Surcouf Royal Navy's X1 M-class submarines. With arrival Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft, guns defense attack. A practical method increasing combat endurance external torpedo tube, loaded port.The ability submarines approach enemy harbours covertly led minelayers. Minelaying submarines World War I World War II built purpose. Modern submarine-laid mines, British Mark 5 Stonefish Mark 6 Sea Urchin, deployed submarine's torpedo tubes.After World War II, US USSR experimented submarine-launched cruise missiles SSM-N-8 Regulus P-5 Pyatyorka. Such missiles required submarine surface fire missiles. They forerunners modern submarine-launched cruise missiles, fired torpedo tubes submerged submarines, example US BGM-109 Tomahawk Russian RPK-2 Viyuga versions surface–to–surface anti-ship missiles Exocet Harpoon, encapsulated submarine launch. Ballistic missiles fired submarine's torpedo tubes, example missiles anti-submarine SUBROC. With internal volume limited desire carry heavier warloads, idea external launch tube revived, encapsulated missiles, tubes internal pressure outer streamlined hulls.The strategic mission SSM-N-8 P-5 submarine-launched ballistic missile US Navy's Polaris missile, subsequently Poseidon Trident missiles.Germany working torpedo tube-launched short-range IDAS missile, ASW helicopters, well surface ships coastal targets. Sensors A submarine variety sensors, depending missions. Modern military submarines entirely suite passive active sonars locate targets. Active sonar relies audible "ping" generate echoes reveal objects submarine. Active systems rarely used, reveals sub's presence. Passive sonar set sensitive hydrophones set hull trailed towed array, trailing feet sub. The towed array mainstay NATO submarine detection systems, reduces flow noise heard operators. Hull mounted sonar employed addition towed array, towed array work shallow depth maneuvering. In addition, sonar blind spot "through" submarine, system front works eliminate problem. As towed array trails submarine, allows submarine system thermocline proper depth; sound passing thermocline distorted lower detection range.Submarines carry radar equipment detect surface ships aircraft. Submarine captains radar detection gear active radar detect targets, radar detected return range, revealing submarine. Periscopes rarely used, position fixes verify contact's identity.Civilian submarines, DSV Alvin Russian Mir submersibles, small active sonar sets viewing ports navigate. The human eye detect sunlight 300 feet (91 m) underwater, high intensity lights illuminate viewing area. Navigation Early submarines navigation aids, modern variety navigation systems. Modern military submarines inertial guidance system navigation submerged, drift error unavoidably builds time. To counter this, crew occasionally Global Positioning System accurate position. The periscope—a retractable tube prism system view surface—is occasionally modern submarines, visibility range short. The Virginia-class Astute-class submarines photonics masts hull-penetrating optical periscopes. These masts deployed surface, electronic sensors visible light, infrared, laser range-finding, electromagnetic surveillance. One benefit hoisting mast surface mast water entire water harder detect visually radar. Communication Military submarines systems communicate distant command centers ships. One VLF (Very Low Frequency) radio, reach submarine surface submerged fairly shallow depth, 250 feet (76 m). ELF (Extremely Low Frequency) reach submarine greater depths, bandwidth generally submerged shallower depth VLF signals reach. A submarine option floating long, buoyant wire antenna shallower depth, allowing VLF transmissions deeply submerged boat.By extending radio mast, submarine "burst transmission" technique. A burst transmission takes fraction second, minimizing submarine's risk detection.To communicate submarines, system Gertrude used. Gertrude basically sonar telephone. Voice communication submarine transmitted power speakers water, detected passive sonars receiving submarine. The range system short, radiates sound water, heard enemy.Civilian submarines similar, albeit powerful systems communicate support ships submersibles area. Life support systems With nuclear power air-independent propulsion, submarines remain submerged months time. Conventional diesel submarines periodically resurface snorkel recharge batteries. Most modern military submarines generate breathing oxygen electrolysis water (using device called "Elektrolytic Oxygen Generator"). Atmosphere control equipment includes CO2 scrubber, amine absorbent remove gas air diffuse waste pumped overboard. A machine catalyst convert carbon monoxide carbon dioxide (removed CO2 scrubber) bonds hydrogen produced ship's storage battery oxygen atmosphere produce water, used. An atmosphere monitoring system samples air areas ship nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, R-12 R-114 refrigerants, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, gases. Poisonous gases removed, oxygen replenished oxygen bank located ballast tank. Some heavier submarines oxygen bleed stations (forward aft).

The conditions submarine difficult crew members work isolation periods time, family contact. Submarines maintain radio silence avoid detection. Operating submarine dangerous, peacetime, submarines lost accidents. Women Most navies prohibited women serving submarines, permitted serve surface warships. The Royal Norwegian Navy navy allow females submarine crews 1985. The Royal Danish Navy allowed female submariners 1988. Others suit including Swedish Navy (1989), Royal Australian Navy (1998), German Navy (2001) Canadian Navy (2002). In 1995, Solveig Krey Royal Norwegian Navy female officer assume command military submarine, HNoMS Kobben.On 8 December 2011, British Defence Secretary Philip Hammond announced UK's ban women submarines lifted 2013. Previously fears women risk build-up carbon dioxide submarine. But study medical reason exclude women, pregnant women excluded. Similar dangers pregnant woman fetus barred females submarine service Sweden 1983, positions Swedish Navy. Today, pregnant women allowed serve submarines Sweden. However, policymakers thought discriminatory general ban demanded females individual merits suitability evaluated compared candidates. Further, female complying high demands pregnant. In May 2014, three women RN's female submariners.Women served US Navy surface ships 1993, 2011–2012, began serving submarines time. Until presently, Navy allowed three exceptions women board military submarines: female civilian technicians days most, women midshipmen overnight summer training Navy ROTC Naval Academy, family members one-day dependent cruises. In 2009, senior officials, including then-Secretary Navy Ray Mabus, Joint Chief Staff Admiral Michael Mullen, Chief Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead, began process finding implement females submarines. The US Navy rescinded "no women subs" policy 2010.Both US British navies operate nuclear-powered submarines deploy periods months longer. Other navies permit women serve submarines operate conventionally powered submarines, deploy shorter periods—usually months. Prior change US, nation nuclear submarines permitted women serve board.In 2011, class female submarine officers graduated Naval Submarine School's Submarine Officer Basic Course (SOBC) Naval Submarine Base New London. Additionally, senior ranking experienced female supply officers surface warfare specialty attended SOBC well, proceeding fleet Ballistic Missile (SSBN) Guided Missile (SSGN) submarines female submarine officers 2011. By 2011, women assigned Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine USS Wyoming.

A motherboard (sometimes alternatively mainboard, system board, baseboard, planar board logic board, colloquially, mobo) printed circuit board (PCB) general purpose microcomputers expandable systems. It holds allows communication crucial electronic components system, central processing unit (CPU) memory, connectors peripherals. Unlike backplane, motherboard sub-systems central processor, chipset's input/output memory controllers, interface connectors, components integrated general purpose use.Motherboard refers PCB expansion capability suggests, board referred "mother" components attached it, include peripherals, interface cards, daughtercards: sound cards, video cards, network cards, drives, forms persistent storage; TV tuner cards, cards providing extra USB FireWire slots variety custom components.Similarly, term mainboard applied devices single board additional expansions capability, controlling boards laser printers, televisions, washing machines embedded systems limited expansion abilities. History Prior microprocessor, digital computer consisted multiple printed circuit boards card-cage case components connected backplane, set interconnected sockets. In designs, copper wires discrete connections card connector pins, printed circuit boards standard practice. The Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, peripherals housed individual printed circuit boards, plugged backplane. The ubiquitous S-100 bus 1970s example type backplane system.The popular computers 1980s Apple II IBM PC published schematic diagrams documentation permitted rapid reverse-engineering third-party replacement motherboards. Usually intended building computers compatible exemplars, motherboards offered additional performance features upgrade manufacturer's original equipment.During 1980s 1990s, economical move increasing number peripheral functions motherboard. In 1980s, personal computer motherboards began include single ICs (also called Super I/O chips) capable supporting set low-speed peripherals: keyboard, mouse, floppy disk drive, serial ports, parallel ports. By 1990s, personal computer motherboards included consumer grade embedded audio, video, storage, networking functions expansion cards all; higher-end systems 3D gaming computer graphics typically retained graphics card separate component. Business PCs, workstations, servers expansion cards, robust functions, higher speeds; systems fewer embedded components.Laptop notebook computers developed 1990s integrated common peripherals. This included motherboards upgradeable components, trend continue smaller systems introduced turn century (like tablet computer netbook). Memory, processors, network controllers, power source, storage integrated systems. Design A motherboard electrical connections components system communicate. Unlike backplane, central processing unit hosts subsystems devices.A typical desktop computer microprocessor, memory, essential components connected motherboard. Other components external storage, controllers video display sound, peripheral devices attached motherboard plug-in cards cables; modern microcomputers increasingly common integrate peripherals motherboard itself.An component motherboard microprocessor's supporting chipset, supporting interfaces CPU buses external components. This chipset determines, extent, features capabilities motherboard.Modern motherboards include:Sockets (or slots) microprocessors installed. In case CPUs ball grid array packages, VIA C3, CPU directly soldered motherboard.Slots system's memory installed (typically DIMM modules DRAM chips)A chipset forms interface CPU's front-side bus, memory, peripheral busesNon-volatile memory chips (usually Flash ROM modern motherboards) system's firmware BIOSA clock generator produces system clock signal synchronize componentsSlots expansion cards (the interface system buses supported chipset)Power connectors, receive electrical power computer power supply distribute CPU, chipset, memory, expansion cards. As 2007, graphics cards (e.g. GeForce 8 Radeon R600) require power motherboard provide, dedicated connectors introduced attach directly power supply.Connectors drives, typically SATA only. Disk drives connect power supply.Additionally, motherboards include logic connectors support commonly input devices, USB mouse devices keyboards. Early personal computers Apple II IBM PC included minimal peripheral support motherboard. Occasionally video interface hardware integrated motherboard; example, Apple II rarely IBM-compatible computers IBM PC Jr. Additional peripherals disk controllers serial ports provided expansion cards.Given high thermal design power high-speed computer CPUs components, modern motherboards include heat sinks mounting points fans dissipate excess heat. Form factor Motherboards produced variety sizes shapes called computer factor, individual computer manufacturers. However, motherboards IBM-compatible systems designed fit case sizes. As 2007, desktop computer motherboards ATX standard factor — Macintosh Sun computers, built commodity components. A case's motherboard PSU factor match, smaller factor motherboards family fit larger cases. For example, ATX case accommodate microATX motherboard.Laptop computers generally highly integrated, miniaturized customized motherboards. This reasons laptop computers difficult upgrade expensive repair. Often failure laptop component requires replacement entire motherboard, expensive desktop motherboard number integrated components custom shape size. CPU sockets A CPU socket (central processing unit) slot electrical component attaches Printed Circuit Board (PCB) designed house CPU (also called microprocessor). It type integrated circuit socket designed high pin counts. A CPU socket functions, including physical structure support CPU, support heat sink, facilitating replacement (as well reducing cost), importantly, forming electrical interface CPU PCB. CPU sockets motherboard desktop server computers (laptops typically surface mount CPUs), based Intel x86 architecture. A CPU socket type motherboard chipset support CPU series speed. Integrated peripherals With steadily declining costs size integrated circuits, include support peripherals motherboard. By combining functions PCB, physical size total cost system reduced; highly integrated motherboards popular small factor budget computers.Disk controllers floppy disk drive, 2 PATA drives, 6 SATA drives (including RAID 0/1 support)integrated graphics controller supporting 2D 3D graphics, VGA TV outputintegrated sound card supporting 8-channel (7.1) audio S/PDIF outputFast Ethernet network controller 10/100 Mbit networkingUSB 2.0 controller supporting 12 USB portsIrDA controller infrared data communication (e.g. IrDA-enabled cellular phone printer)Temperature, voltage, fan-speed sensors allow software monitor health computer components. Peripheral card slots A typical motherboard number connections depending standard factor.A standard, modern ATX motherboard typically three PCI-Express 16x connection graphics card, legacy PCI slots expansion cards, PCI-E 1x (which superseded PCI). A standard EATX motherboard PCI-E 16x connection graphics cards, varying number PCI PCI-E 1x slots. It PCI-E 4x slot (will vary brands models).Some motherboards PCI-E 16x slots, allow 2 monitors hardware, graphics technology called SLI (for Nvidia) Crossfire (for AMD). These allow 2 4 graphics cards linked together, allow better performance intensive graphical computing tasks, gaming, video editing, etc. Temperature reliability Motherboards generally air cooled heat sinks mounted larger chips, Northbridge, modern motherboards. Insufficient improper cooling damage internal components computer, crash. Passive cooling, single fan mounted power supply, desktop computer CPU's 1990s; then, required CPU fans mounted heat sinks, rising clock speeds power consumption. Most motherboards connectors additional case fans integrated temperature sensors detect motherboard CPU temperatures controllable fan connectors BIOS operating system regulate fan speed. Alternatively computers water cooling system fans.Some small factor computers theater PCs designed quiet energy-efficient operation boast fan-less designs. This typically requires low-power CPU, well careful layout motherboard components allow heat sink placement.A 2003 study spurious computer crashes general reliability issues, ranging screen image distortions I/O read/write errors, attributed software peripheral hardware aging capacitors PC motherboards. Ultimately faulty electrolyte formulation, issue termed capacitor plague.Motherboards electrolytic capacitors filter DC power distributed board. These capacitors temperature-dependent rate, water based electrolytes slowly evaporate. This lead loss capacitance subsequent motherboard malfunctions voltage instabilities. While capacitors rated 2000 hours operation 105 °C (221 °F), expected design life roughly doubles 10 °C (18 °F) this. At 45 °C (113 °F) lifetime 15 years expected. This appears reasonable computer motherboard. However, manufacturers deliver substandard capacitors, reduce life expectancy. Inadequate case cooling elevated temperatures easily exacerbate problem. It possible, time-consuming, find replace failed capacitors personal computer motherboards. Air pollution reliability High rates motherboard failures China India appear "sulfurous air pollution produced coal" that's burned generate electricity. Air pollution corrodes circuitry, Intel researchers. Bootstrapping Basic input output system Motherboards non-volatile memory initialize system load startup software, operating system, external peripheral device. Microcomputers Apple II IBM PC ROM chips mounted sockets motherboard. At power-up, central processor load program counter address boot ROM start executing instructions ROM. These instructions initialized tested system hardware, displayed system screen, performed RAM checks, loaded initial program external peripheral device. If available, computer perform tasks memory stores display error message, depending model design computer ROM version. For example, Apple II original IBM PC Microsoft Cassette BASIC ROM start program loaded disk.Most modern motherboard designs BIOS, stored EEPROM chip soldered socketed motherboard, booting operating system. Non-operating system boot programs supported modern IBM PC-descended machines, nowadays assumed boot program complex operating system Microsoft Windows Linux. When power supplied motherboard, BIOS firmware tests configures memory, circuitry, peripherals.

An operating system (OS) system software manages computer hardware software resources common services computer programs. All computer programs, excluding firmware, require operating system function.Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks efficient system include accounting software cost allocation processor time, mass storage, printing, resources.For hardware functions input output memory allocation, operating system acts intermediary programs computer hardware, application code executed directly hardware frequently system calls OS function interrupted it. Operating systems devices computer – cellular phones video game consoles web servers supercomputers.The desktop operating system Microsoft Windows market share 83.3%. macOS Apple Inc. second (11.2%), varieties Linux third position (1.55%). In mobile (smartphone tablet combined) sector, third quarter 2016 data, Android Google 87.5 percent growth rate 10.3 percent year, iOS Apple 12.1 percent year decrease market share 5.2 percent, operating systems amount 0.3 percent. Linux distributions server supercomputing sectors. Other specialized classes operating systems, embedded real-time systems, exist applications. Types operating systems Single- multi-tasking A single-tasking system program time, multi-tasking operating system allows program running concurrency. This achieved time-sharing, dividing processor multiple processes interrupted repeatedly slices task-scheduling subsystem operating system. Multi-tasking characterized preemptive co-operative types. In preemptive multitasking, operating system slices CPU dedicates slot programs. Unix-like operating systems, e.g., Solaris, Linux, well AmigaOS support preemptive multitasking. Cooperative multitasking achieved relying process processes defined manner. 16-bit versions Microsoft Windows cooperative multi-tasking. 32-bit versions Windows NT Win9x, preemptive multi-tasking. Single- multi-user Single-user operating systems facilities distinguish users, allow multiple programs tandem. A multi-user operating system extends basic concept multi-tasking facilities identify processes resources, disk space, belonging multiple users, system permits multiple users interact system time. Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks efficient system include accounting software cost allocation processor time, mass storage, printing, resources multiple users. Distributed A distributed operating system manages group distinct computers appear single computer. The development networked computers linked communicate distributed computing. Distributed computations carried machine. When computers group work cooperation, distributed system. Templated In OS, distributed cloud computing context, templating refers creating single virtual machine image guest operating system, saving tool multiple running virtual machines. The technique virtualization cloud computing management, common server warehouses. Embedded Embedded operating systems designed embedded computer systems. They designed operate small machines PDAs autonomy. They operate limited number resources. They compact extremely efficient design. Windows CE Minix 3 examples embedded operating systems. Real-time A real-time operating system operating system guarantees process events data moment time. A real-time operating system single- multi-tasking, multitasking, specialized scheduling algorithms deterministic nature behavior achieved. An event-driven system switches tasks based priorities external events time-sharing operating systems switch tasks based clock interrupts Library A library operating system services typical operating system provides, networking, provided libraries. These libraries composed application configuration code construct unikernels – specialized, single address space, machine images deployed cloud embedded environments. History Early computers built perform series single tasks, calculator. Basic operating system features developed 1950s, resident monitor functions automatically programs succession speed processing. Operating systems exist modern complex forms 1960s. Hardware features added, enabled runtime libraries, interrupts, parallel processing. When personal computers popular 1980s, operating systems concept larger computers.In 1940s, earliest electronic digital systems operating systems. Electronic systems programmed rows mechanical switches jumper wires plug boards. These special-purpose systems that, example, generated ballistics tables military controlled printing payroll checks data punched paper cards. After programmable general purpose computers invented, machine languages (consisting strings binary digits 0 1 punched paper tape) introduced speed programming process (Stern, 1981).In 1950s, computer execute program time. Each user sole computer limited period arrive scheduled program data punched paper cards punched tape. The program loaded machine, machine set work program completed crashed. Programs generally debugged front panel toggle switches panel lights. It Alan Turing master Manchester Mark 1 machine, deriving primitive conception operating system principles universal Turing machine.Later machines libraries programs, linked user's program assist operations input output generating computer code human-readable symbolic code. This genesis modern-day operating system. However, machines single job time. At Cambridge University England job queue washing (clothes line) tapes hung colored clothes-pegs indicate job-priority.An improvement Atlas Supervisor introduced Manchester Atlas commissioned 1962, "considered recognisable modern operating system". Brinch Hansen described "the breakthrough history operating systems." Mainframes Through 1950s, major features pioneered field operating systems, including batch processing, input/output interrupt, buffering, multitasking, spooling, runtime libraries, link-loading, programs sorting records files. These features included included application software option application programmers, separate operating system applications. In 1959, SHARE Operating System released integrated utility IBM 704, 709 7090 mainframes, supplanted IBSYS/IBJOB 709, 7090 7094.During 1960s, IBM's OS/360 introduced concept single OS spanning entire product line, crucial System/360 machines. IBM's current mainframe operating systems distant descendants original system applications written OS/360 modern machines.OS/360 pioneered concept operating system track system resources used, including program data space allocation memory file space secondary storage, file locking update. When process terminated reason, resources re-claimed operating system.The alternative CP-67 system S/360-67 started IBM operating systems focused concept virtual machines. Other operating systems IBM S/360 series mainframes included systems developed IBM: COS/360 (Compatibility Operating System), DOS/360 (Disk Operating System), TSS/360 (Time Sharing System), TOS/360 (Tape Operating System), BOS/360 (Basic Operating System), ACP (Airline Control Program), well non-IBM systems: MTS (Michigan Terminal System), MUSIC (Multi-User System Interactive Computing), ORVYL (Stanford Timesharing System).Control Data Corporation developed SCOPE operating system 1960s, batch processing. In cooperation University Minnesota, Kronos NOS operating systems developed 1970s, supported simultaneous batch timesharing use. Like commercial timesharing systems, interface extension Dartmouth BASIC operating systems, pioneering efforts timesharing programming languages. In 1970s, Control Data University Illinois developed PLATO operating system, plasma panel displays long-distance sharing networks. Plato remarkably innovative time, featuring real-time chat, multi-user graphical games.In 1961, Burroughs Corporation introduced B5000 MCP, (Master Control Program) operating system. The B5000 stack machine designed exclusively support high-level languages machine language assembler, MCP OS written exclusively high-level language – ESPOL, dialect ALGOL. MCP introduced ground-breaking innovations, commercial implementation virtual memory. During development AS/400, IBM approach Burroughs licence MCP AS/400 hardware. This proposal declined Burroughs management protect existing hardware production. MCP today Unisys ClearPath/MCP computers.UNIVAC, commercial computer manufacturer, produced series EXEC operating systems. Like main-frame systems, batch-oriented system managed magnetic drums, disks, card readers printers. In 1970s, UNIVAC produced Real-Time Basic (RTB) system support large-scale sharing, patterned Dartmouth BC system.General Electric MIT developed General Electric Comprehensive Operating Supervisor (GECOS), introduced concept ringed security privilege levels. After acquisition Honeywell renamed General Comprehensive Operating System (GCOS).Digital Equipment Corporation developed operating systems computer lines, including TOPS-10 TOPS-20 sharing systems 36-bit PDP-10 class systems. Before widespread UNIX, TOPS-10 popular system universities, ARPANET community.From 1960s 1970s, hardware capabilities evolved allowed ported software system. Early systems utilized microprogramming implement features systems order permit underlying computer architectures appear series. In fact, 360s 360/40 (except 360/165 360/168) microprogrammed implementations.The enormous investment software systems 1960s caused original computer manufacturers continue develop compatible operating systems hardware. Notable supported mainframe operating systems include:Burroughs MCP – B5000, 1961 Unisys Clearpath/MCP, presentIBM OS/360 – IBM System/360, 1966 IBM z/OS, presentIBM CP-67 – IBM System/360, 1967 IBM z/VMUNIVAC EXEC 8 – UNIVAC 1108, 1967, OS 2200 Unisys Clearpath Dorado, Microcomputers The microcomputers capacity elaborate operating systems developed mainframes minis; minimalistic operating systems developed, loaded ROM monitors. One notable disk operating system CP/M, supported microcomputers closely imitated Microsoft's MS-DOS, popular operating system chosen IBM PC (IBM's version called IBM DOS PC DOS). In 1980s, Apple Computer Inc. (now Apple Inc.) abandoned popular Apple II series microcomputers introduce Apple Macintosh computer innovative graphical user interface (GUI) Mac OS.The introduction Intel 80386 CPU chip October 1985, 32-bit architecture paging capabilities, provided personal computers ability multitasking operating systems earlier minicomputers mainframes. Microsoft responded progress hiring Dave Cutler, developed VMS operating system Digital Equipment Corporation. He lead development Windows NT operating system, continues serve basis Microsoft's operating systems line. Steve Jobs, co-founder Apple Inc., started NeXT Computer Inc., developed NEXTSTEP operating system. NEXTSTEP acquired Apple Inc. used, code FreeBSD core Mac OS X (macOS latest change).The GNU Project started activist programmer Richard Stallman goal creating complete free software replacement proprietary UNIX operating system. While project highly duplicating functionality parts UNIX, development GNU Hurd kernel proved unproductive. In 1991, Finnish computer science student Linus Torvalds, cooperation volunteers collaborating Internet, released version Linux kernel. It merged GNU user space components system software complete operating system. Since then, combination major components referred simply "Linux" software industry, naming convention Stallman Free Software Foundation remain opposed to, preferring GNU/Linux. The Berkeley Software Distribution, BSD, UNIX derivative distributed University California, Berkeley, starting 1970s. Freely distributed ported minicomputers, eventually gained PCs, FreeBSD, NetBSD OpenBSD. Examples operating systems Unix Unix-like operating systems Unix originally written assembly language. Ken Thompson wrote B, based BCPL, based experience MULTICS project. B replaced C, Unix, rewritten C, developed large, complex family inter-related operating systems influential modern operating system (see History).The Unix-like family diverse group operating systems, major sub-categories including System V, BSD, Linux. The "UNIX" trademark The Open Group licenses operating system conform definitions. "UNIX-like" commonly refer set operating systems resemble original UNIX.Unix-like systems variety computer architectures. They heavily servers business, well workstations academic engineering environments. Free UNIX variants, Linux BSD, popular areas.Four operating systems certified The Open Group (holder Unix trademark) Unix. HP's HP-UX IBM's AIX descendants original System V Unix designed vendor's hardware. In contrast, Sun Microsystems's Solaris multiple types hardware, including x86 Sparc servers, PCs. Apple's macOS, replacement Apple's earlier (non-Unix) Mac OS, hybrid kernel-based BSD variant derived NeXTSTEP, Mach, FreeBSD.Unix interoperability sought establishing POSIX standard. The POSIX standard applied operating system, originally created Unix variants. BSD descendants A subgroup Unix family Berkeley Software Distribution family, includes FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD. These operating systems commonly webservers, function personal computer OS. The Internet owes existence BSD, protocols commonly computers connect, send receive data network implemented refined BSD. The World Wide Web demonstrated number computers running OS based BSD called NeXTSTEP.In 1974, University California, Berkeley installed Unix system. Over time, students staff computer science department began adding programs things easier, text editors. When Berkeley received VAX computers 1978 Unix installed, school's undergraduates modified Unix order advantage computer's hardware possibilities. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency US Department Defense interest, decided fund project. Many schools, corporations, government organizations notice started Berkeley's version Unix official distributed AT&T.Steve Jobs, leaving Apple Inc. 1985, formed NeXT Inc., company manufactured high-end computers running variation BSD called NeXTSTEP. One computers Tim Berners-Lee webserver create World Wide Web.Developers Keith Bostic encouraged project replace non-free code originated Bell Labs. Once done, however, AT&T sued. After years legal disputes, BSD project spawned number free derivatives, NetBSD FreeBSD (both 1993), OpenBSD (from NetBSD 1995). macOS macOS (formerly "Mac OS X" "OS X") open core graphical operating systems developed, marketed, sold Apple Inc., latest pre-loaded currently shipping Macintosh computers. macOS successor original classic Mac OS, Apple's primary operating system 1984. Unlike predecessor, macOS UNIX operating system built technology developed NeXT second half 1980s Apple purchased company 1997. The operating system released 1999 Mac OS X Server 1.0, March 2001 client version (Mac OS X v10.0 "Cheetah"). Since then, distinct "client" "server" editions macOS released, merged OS X 10.7 "Lion".Prior merging macOS, server edition – macOS Server – architecturally identical desktop counterpart Apple's Macintosh server hardware. macOS Server included work group management administration software tools simplified access network services, including mail transfer agent, Samba server, LDAP server, domain server, others. With Mac OS X v10.7 Lion, server aspects Mac OS X Server integrated client version product re-branded "OS X" (dropping "Mac" name). The server tools offered application. Linux The Linux kernel originated 1991, project Linus Torvalds, university student Finland. He posted project newsgroup computer students programmers, received support assistance volunteers succeeded creating complete functional kernel.Linux Unix-like, developed Unix code, BSD variants. Because open license model, Linux kernel code study modification, range computing machinery supercomputers smart-watches. Although estimates Linux 1.82% "desktop" (or laptop) PCs, servers embedded systems cell phones. Linux superseded Unix platforms supercomputers including 385. Many computers Green500 (but order), Linux runs 10. Linux commonly small energy-efficient computers, smartphones smartwatches. The Linux kernel popular distributions, Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint Google's Android. Google Chrome OS Chrome OS operating system based Linux kernel designed Google. It developed open Chromium OS open source variant Google proprietary variant (similar split Chrome Chromium browser). Since Chromium OS targets computer users spend Internet, web browser limited ability local applications, built-in file manager player (in versions, (modified) Android apps supported, browser support them). Instead, relies Internet applications (or Web apps) web browser accomplish tasks processing. Chromium OS differs Chrome OS Chromium open-source developers Chrome OS operating system shipped Chromebooks. Microsoft Windows Microsoft Windows family proprietary operating systems designed Microsoft Corporation targeted Intel architecture based computers, estimated 88.9 percent total usage share Web connected computers. The latest version Windows 10.In 2011, Windows 7 overtook Windows XP common version use.Microsoft Windows released 1985, operating environment running MS-DOS, standard operating system shipped Intel architecture personal computers time. In 1995, Windows 95 released MS-DOS bootstrap. For backwards compatibility, Win9x real-mode MS-DOS 16-bit Windows 3.x drivers. Windows ME, released 2000, version Win9x family. Later versions based Windows NT kernel. Current client versions Windows IA-32, x86-64 32-bit ARM microprocessors. In addition Itanium supported older server version Windows Server 2008 R2. In past, Windows NT supported additional architectures.Server editions Windows used. In years, Microsoft expended capital effort promote Windows server operating system. However, Windows' usage servers widespread personal computers Windows competes Linux BSD server market share.ReactOS Windows-alternative operating system, developed principles Windows – Microsoft's code. Other There operating systems day longer so, AmigaOS; OS/2 IBM Microsoft; classic Mac OS, non-Unix precursor Apple's macOS; BeOS; XTS-300; RISC OS; MorphOS; Haiku; BareMetal FreeMint. Some niche markets continue developed minority platforms enthusiast communities specialist applications. OpenVMS, DEC, active development Hewlett-Packard. Yet operating systems exclusively academia, operating systems education operating system concepts. A typical example system fulfills roles MINIX, example Singularity purely research.Other operating systems failed market share, introduced innovations influenced mainstream operating systems, Bell Labs' Plan 9. Components The components operating system exist order parts computer work together. All user software operating system order hardware, simple mouse keyboard complex Internet component. Kernel With firmware device drivers, kernel basic level control computer's hardware devices. It manages memory access programs RAM, determines programs access hardware resources, sets resets CPU's operating optimal operation times, organizes data long-term non-volatile storage file systems disks, tapes, flash memory, etc. Program execution The operating system interface application program computer hardware, application program interact hardware obeying rules procedures programmed operating system. The operating system set services simplify development execution application programs. Executing application program involves creation process operating system kernel assigns memory space resources, establishes priority process multi-tasking systems, loads program binary code memory, initiates execution application program interacts user hardware devices. Interrupts Interrupts central operating systems, efficient operating system interact react environment. The alternative – operating system "watch" sources input events (polling) require action – older systems small stacks (50 60 bytes) unusual modern systems stacks. Interrupt-based programming directly supported modern CPUs. Interrupts computer automatically saving local register contexts, running code response events. Even basic computers support hardware interrupts, allow programmer code event takes place.When interrupt received, computer's hardware automatically suspends program currently running, saves status, runs computer code associated interrupt; analogous placing bookmark book response phone call. In modern operating systems, interrupts handled operating system's kernel. Interrupts computer's hardware running program.When hardware device triggers interrupt, operating system's kernel decides deal event, generally running processing code. The amount code depends priority interrupt (for example: person responds smoke detector alarm answering phone). The processing hardware interrupts task delegated software called device driver, operating system's kernel, program, both. Device drivers relay running program means.A program trigger interrupt operating system. If program wishes access hardware, example, interrupt operating system's kernel, control passed kernel. The kernel processes request. If program wishes additional resources (or wishes resources) memory, triggers interrupt kernel's attention. Modes Modern microprocessors (CPU MPU) support multiple modes operation. CPUs capability offer modes: user mode supervisor mode. In general terms, supervisor mode operation allows unrestricted access machine resources, including MPU instructions. User mode operation sets limits instruction typically disallows direct access machine resources. CPUs modes user mode well, virtual modes order emulate older processor types, 16-bit processors 32-bit one, 32-bit processors 64-bit one.At power-on reset, system supervisor mode. Once operating system kernel loaded started boundary user mode supervisor mode (also kernel mode) established.Supervisor mode kernel level tasks unrestricted access hardware, controlling memory accessed, communicating devices disk drives video display devices. User mode, contrast, else. Application programs, processors database managers, operate user mode, access machine resources turning control kernel, process switch supervisor mode. Typically, transfer control kernel achieved executing software interrupt instruction, Motorola 68000 TRAP instruction. The software interrupt microprocessor switch user mode supervisor mode executing code allows kernel control.In user mode, programs access restricted set microprocessor instructions, generally execute instructions disruption system's operation. In supervisor mode, instruction execution restrictions typically removed, allowing kernel unrestricted access machine resources.The term "user mode resource" generally refers CPU registers, running program allowed alter. Attempts alter resources generally switch supervisor mode, operating system deal illegal operation program attempting, example, forceably terminating ("killing") program). Memory management Among things, multiprogramming operating system kernel responsible managing system memory currently programs. This ensures program interfere memory program. Since programs share, program independent access memory.Cooperative memory management, operating systems, assumes programs voluntary kernel's memory manager, exceed allocated memory. This system memory management more, programs bugs exceed allocated memory. If program fails, memory programs overwritten. Malicious programs viruses purposefully alter program's memory, operation operating system itself. With cooperative memory management, takes misbehaved program crash system.Memory protection enables kernel limit process' access computer's memory. Various methods memory protection exist, including memory segmentation paging. All methods require level hardware support (such 80286 MMU), exist computers.In segmentation paging, protected mode registers CPU memory address allow running program access. Attempts access addresses trigger interrupt CPU re-enter supervisor mode, placing kernel charge. This called segmentation violation Seg-V short, difficult assign meaningful operation, misbehaving program, kernel generally resorts terminating offending program, reports error.Windows versions 3.1 ME level memory protection, programs easily circumvent it. A general protection fault produced, indicating segmentation violation occurred; however, system crash anyway. Virtual memory The virtual memory addressing (such paging segmentation) kernel choose memory program time, allowing operating system memory locations multiple tasks.If program access memory current range accessible memory, allocated it, kernel interrupted program exceed allocated memory. (See memory management.) Under UNIX kind interrupt referred fault.When kernel detects fault generally adjusts virtual memory range program triggered it, granting access memory requested. This kernel discretionary power application's memory stored, allocated yet.In modern operating systems, memory accessed frequently temporarily stored disk space programs. This called swapping, area memory multiple programs, memory area swapped exchanged demand."Virtual memory" programmer user perception larger amount RAM computer there. Multitasking Multitasking refers running multiple independent computer programs computer; appearance performing tasks time. Since computers things time, generally time-sharing, program share computer's execute.An operating system kernel scheduling program determines process spends executing, order execution control passed programs. Control passed process kernel, allows program access CPU memory. Later, control returned kernel mechanism, program allowed CPU. This so-called passing control kernel applications called context switch.An model governed allocation programs called cooperative multitasking. In model, control passed program kernel, execute explicitly returning control kernel. This malicious malfunctioning program prevent programs CPU, hang entire system enters infinite loop.Modern operating systems extend concepts application preemption device drivers kernel code, operating system preemptive control internal run-times well.The philosophy governing preemptive multitasking ensuring programs regular CPU. This implies programs limited allowed spend CPU interrupted. To accomplish this, modern operating system kernels timed interrupt. A protected mode timer set kernel triggers return supervisor mode elapsed. (See sections Interrupts Dual Mode Operation.)On single user operating systems cooperative multitasking perfectly adequate, computers generally small number well tested programs. The AmigaOS exception, preemptive multitasking version. Windows NT version Microsoft Windows enforced preemptive multitasking, reach user market Windows XP (since Windows NT targeted professionals). Disk access file systems Access data stored disks central feature operating systems. Computers store data disks files, structured order allow faster access, higher reliability, better drive's space. The files stored disk called file system, enables files names attributes. It allows stored hierarchy directories folders arranged directory tree.Early operating systems generally supported single type disk drive kind file system. Early file systems limited capacity, speed, kinds file names directory structures use. These limitations reflected limitations operating systems designed for, making difficult operating system support file system.While simpler operating systems support limited range options accessing storage systems, operating systems UNIX Linux support technology virtual file system VFS. An operating system UNIX supports array storage devices, design file systems, allowing accessed common application programming interface (API). This unnecessary programs knowledge device accessing. A VFS allows operating system programs access unlimited number devices infinite variety file systems installed them, device drivers file system drivers.A connected storage device, drive, accessed device driver. The device driver understands language drive translate language standard language operating system access disk drives. On UNIX, language block devices.When kernel appropriate device driver place, access contents disk drive raw format, file systems. A file system driver translate commands access file system standard set commands operating system talk file systems. Programs deal file systems basis filenames, directories/folders, contained hierarchical structure. They create, delete, open, close files, well gather them, including access permissions, size, free space, creation modification dates.Various differences file systems supporting file systems difficult. Allowed characters file names, case sensitivity, presence kinds file attributes implementation single interface file system daunting task. Operating systems recommend (and support natively) file systems designed them; example, NTFS Windows ext3 ReiserFS Linux. However, practice, third party drivers support file systems general-purpose operating systems (for example, NTFS Linux NTFS-3g, ext2/3 ReiserFS Windows third-party software).Support file systems highly varied modern operating systems, common file systems operating systems include support drivers for. Operating systems vary file system support disk formats installed on. Under Windows, file system limited application media; example, CDs ISO 9660 UDF, Windows Vista, NTFS file system operating system installed on. It install Linux types file systems. Unlike operating systems, Linux UNIX allow file system stored in, drive, disc (CD, DVD...), USB flash drive, contained file located file system. Device drivers A device driver type computer software developed allow interaction hardware devices. Typically constitutes interface communicating device, computer bus communications subsystem hardware connected to, providing commands and/or receiving data device, end, requisite interfaces operating system software applications. It specialized hardware-dependent computer program operating system enables program, typically operating system applications software package computer program running operating system kernel, interact transparently hardware device, requisite interrupt handling asynchronous time-dependent hardware interfacing needs.The design goal device drivers abstraction. Every model hardware (even class device) different. Newer models released manufacturers reliable better performance newer models controlled differently. Computers operating systems expected control device, future. To solve problem, operating systems essentially dictate type device controlled. The function device driver translate operating system mandated function calls device calls. In theory device, controlled manner, function correctly suitable driver available. This driver ensures device appears operate operating system's point view.Under versions Windows Vista versions Linux 2.6, driver execution co-operative, meaning driver entered infinite loop freeze system. More revisions operating systems incorporate kernel preemption, kernel interrupts driver tasks, separates process receives response device driver, tasks do. Networking Currently operating systems support variety networking protocols, hardware, applications them. This computers running dissimilar operating systems participate common network sharing resources computing, files, printers, scanners wired wireless connections. Networks essentially allow computer's operating system access resources remote computer support functions resources connected directly local computer. This includes simple communication, networked file systems sharing computer's graphics sound hardware. Some network services allow resources computer accessed transparently, SSH allows networked users direct access computer's command interface.Client/server networking allows program computer, called client, connect network computer, called server. Servers offer (or host) services network computers users. These services provided ports numbered access points server's network address. Each number associated maximum running program, responsible handling requests port. A daemon, user program, turn access local hardware resources computer passing requests operating system kernel.Many operating systems support vendor-specific open networking protocols well, example, SNA IBM systems, DECnet systems Digital Equipment Corporation, Microsoft-specific protocols (SMB) Windows. Specific protocols tasks supported NFS file access. Protocols ESound, esd easily extended network sound local applications, remote system's sound hardware. Security A computer secure depends number technologies working properly. A modern operating system access number resources, software running system, external devices networks kernel.The operating system capable distinguishing requests allowed processed, processed. While systems simply distinguish "privileged" "non-privileged", systems commonly requester identity, user name. To establish identity process authentication. Often username quoted, username password. Other methods authentication, magnetic cards biometric data, instead. In cases, connections network, resources accessed authentication (such reading files network share). Also covered concept requester identity authorization; services resources accessible requester logged system tied requester's user account variously configured groups users requester belongs.In addition allow disallow model security, system high level security offers auditing options. These allow tracking requests access resources (such as, "who reading file?"). Internal security, security running program harmful requests carried interrupts operating system kernel. If programs directly access hardware resources, secured.External security involves request computer, login connected console kind network connection. External requests passed device drivers operating system's kernel, passed applications, carried directly. Security operating systems concern highly sensitive data held computers, commercial military nature. The United States Government Department Defense (DoD) created Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) standard sets basic requirements assessing effectiveness security. This vital operating system makers, TCSEC evaluate, classify select trusted operating systems considered processing, storage retrieval sensitive classified information.Network services include offerings file sharing, print services, email, web sites, file transfer protocols (FTP), compromised security. At front security hardware devices firewalls intrusion detection/prevention systems. At operating system level, number software firewalls available, well intrusion detection/prevention systems. Most modern operating systems include software firewall, enabled default. A software firewall configured allow deny network traffic service application running operating system. Therefore, install running insecure service, Telnet FTP, threatened security breach firewall deny traffic connect service port.An alternative strategy, sandbox strategy systems meet Popek Goldberg virtualization requirements, operating system running user programs native code, emulates processor host p-code based system Java.Internal security relevant multi-user systems; allows user system private files users tamper read. Internal security vital auditing use, program bypass operating system, inclusive bypassing auditing. User interface Every computer operated individual requires user interface. The user interface referred shell essential human interaction supported. The user interface views directory structure requests services operating system acquire data input hardware devices, keyboard, mouse credit card reader, requests operating system services display prompts, status messages output hardware devices, video monitor printer. The common forms user interface historically command-line interface, computer commands typed line-by-line, graphical user interface, visual environment (most commonly WIMP) present. Graphical user interfaces Most modern computer systems support graphical user interfaces (GUI), include them. In computer systems, original implementation classic Mac OS, GUI integrated kernel.While technically graphical user interface operating system service, incorporating support operating system kernel allow GUI responsive reducing number context switches required GUI perform output functions. Other operating systems modular, separating graphics subsystem kernel Operating System. In 1980s UNIX, VMS operating systems built way. Linux macOS built way. Modern releases Microsoft Windows Windows Vista implement graphics subsystem user-space; graphics drawing routines versions Windows NT 4.0 Windows Server 2003 exist kernel space. Windows 9x distinction interface kernel.Many computer operating systems allow user install create user interface desire. The X Window System conjunction GNOME KDE Plasma 5 commonly setup Unix Unix-like (BSD, Linux, Solaris) systems. A number Windows shell replacements released Microsoft Windows, offer alternatives included Windows shell, shell separated Windows.Numerous Unix-based GUIs existed time, derived X11. Competition vendors Unix (HP, IBM, Sun) led fragmentation, effort standardize 1990s COSE CDE failed reasons, eventually eclipsed widespread adoption GNOME K Desktop Environment. Prior free software-based toolkits desktop environments, Motif prevalent toolkit/desktop combination (and basis CDE developed).Graphical user interfaces evolve time. For example, Windows modified user interface major version Windows released, Mac OS GUI changed dramatically introduction Mac OS X 1999. Real-time operating systems A real-time operating system (RTOS) operating system intended applications fixed deadlines (real-time computing). Such applications include small embedded systems, automobile engine controllers, industrial robots, spacecraft, industrial control, large-scale computing systems.An example large-scale real-time operating system Transaction Processing Facility developed American Airlines IBM Sabre Airline Reservations System.Embedded systems fixed deadlines real-time operating system VxWorks, PikeOS, eCos, QNX, MontaVista Linux RTLinux. Windows CE real-time operating system shares APIs desktop Windows shares desktop Windows' codebase. Symbian OS RTOS kernel (EKA2) starting version 8.0b.Some embedded systems operating systems Palm OS, BSD, Linux, operating systems support real-time computing. Operating system development hobby Operating system development complicated activities computing hobbyist engage. A hobby operating system classified code directly derived existing operating system, users active developers.In cases, hobby development support "homebrew" computing device, example, simple single-board computer powered 6502 microprocessor. Or, development architecture widespread use. Operating system development entirely concepts, commence modeling existing operating system. In case, hobbyist his/her developer, interact small unstructured group individuals interests.Examples hobby operating system include Syllable. Diversity operating systems portability Application software generally written operating system, hardware. When porting application OS, functionality required application implemented differently OS (the names functions, meaning arguments, etc.) requiring application adapted, changed, maintained.Unix operating system written assembly language, making portable systems native PDP-11.This cost supporting operating systems diversity avoided writing applications software platforms Java Qt. These abstractions borne cost adaptation operating systems system libraries.Another approach operating system vendors standards. For example, POSIX OS abstraction layers commonalities reduce porting costs.

A car wheeled, self-powered motor vehicle transportation product automotive industry. Most definitions term cars designed roads, seating people, typically wheels tyres, constructed principally transport people goods. The year 1886 regarded birth year modern car. In year, German inventor Karl Benz built Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars 20th century. One cars accessible masses 1908 Model T, American car manufactured Ford Motor Company. Cars rapidly United States America, replaced animal-drawn carriages carts, longer accepted Western Europe parts world.Cars equipped controls driving, parking, passenger comfort safety, controlling variety lights. Over decades, additional features controls vehicles, making progressively complex. Examples include rear reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, car entertainment. Most cars 2010s propelled internal combustion engine, fueled deflagration gasoline (also petrol) diesel. Both fuels air pollution blamed contributing climate change global warming. Vehicles alternative fuels ethanol flexible-fuel vehicles natural gas vehicles gaining popularity countries. Electric cars, invented history car, began commercially 2008.There costs benefits car use. The costs car usage include cost of: acquiring vehicle, interest payments (if car financed), repairs auto maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, insurance. The costs society car include: maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, health care, disposing vehicle life. Road traffic accidents largest injury-related deaths worldwide.The benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, convenience. The societal benefits include: economic benefits, job wealth creation car production, sales maintenance, transportation provision, society well-being derived leisure travel opportunities, revenue generation tax opportunities. The ability humans move flexibly far-reaching implications nature societies. It estimated 2010 number cars risen 1 billion vehicles, 500 1986. The numbers increasing rapidly, China, India newly industrialized countries. Etymology The "car" believed originate Latin carrus carrum ("wheeled vehicle"), Middle English carre (meaning two-wheel cart, Old North French). In turn, originated Gaulish karros (a Gallic chariot). The Gaulish language branch Brythoic language Karr; Brythonig language evolved Welsh (and Gaelic) 'Car llusg' (a drag cart sledge) 'car rhyfel' (war chariot) survive. It originally referred wheeled horse-drawn vehicle, cart, carriage, wagon. "Motor car" attested 1895, formal cars British English. "Autocar" variant attested 1895, considered archaic. It literally "self-propelled car". The term "horseless carriage" refer cars built, attested 1895.The "automobile" classical compound derived Ancient Greek autós (αὐτός), meaning "self", Latin mobilis, meaning "movable". It entered English language French, Automobile Club Great Britain 1897. Over time, "automobile" fell favour Britain, replaced "motor car". It remains chiefly North American usage. An abbreviated form, "auto", common refer cars English, considered old-fashioned. The compound formations American English, "auto industry" "auto mechanic". The abbreviated Dutch German. History The working steam-powered vehicle designed—and built—by Ferdinand Verbiest, Flemish member Jesuit mission China 1672. It 65-cm-long scale-model toy Chinese Emperor unable carry driver passenger. It Verbiest's model built.Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot credited building full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicle car 1769; created steam-powered tricycle. He constructed steam tractors French Army, preserved French National Conservatory Arts Crafts. His inventions were, however, handicapped problems water supply maintaining steam pressure. In 1801, Richard Trevithick built demonstrated Puffing Devil road locomotive, believed demonstration steam-powered road vehicle. It unable maintain steam pressure periods, practical use.The development external combustion engines detailed history car, treated separately development true cars. A variety steam-powered road vehicles 19th century, including steam cars, steam buses, phaetons, steam rollers. Sentiment led Locomotive Acts 1865.In 1807, Nicéphore Niépce brother Claude created world's internal combustion engine (which called Pyréolophore), chose install boat river Saone France. Coincidentally, 1807 Swiss inventor François Isaac Rivaz designed 'de Rivaz internal combustion engine' develop world's vehicle powered engine. The Niépces' Pyréolophore fuelled mixture Lycopodium powder (dried spores Lycopodium plant), finely crushed coal dust resin mixed oil, Rivaz mixture hydrogen oxygen. Neither design successful, case others, Samuel Brown, Samuel Morey, Etienne Lenoir hippomobile, produced vehicles (usually adapted carriages carts) powered internal combustion engines.In November 1881, French inventor Gustave Trouvé demonstrated working (three-wheeled) car powered electricity International Exposition Electricity, Paris. Although German engineers (including Gottlieb Daimler, Wilhelm Maybach, Siegfried Marcus) working problem time, Karl Benz generally acknowledged inventor modern car.In 1879, Benz granted patent engine, designed 1878. Many inventions internal combustion engine feasible powering vehicle. His Motorwagen built 1885 Mannheim, Germany. He awarded patent application 29 January 1886 (under auspices major company, Benz & Cie., founded 1883). Benz began promotion vehicle 3 July 1886, 25 Benz vehicles sold 1888 1893, four-wheeler introduced model intended affordability. They powered four-stroke engines design. Emile Roger France, producing Benz engines license, Benz car products. Because France open cars, initially built sold France Roger Benz sold Germany. In August 1888 Bertha Benz, wife Karl Benz, undertook road trip car, prove road-worthiness husband's invention.In 1896, Benz designed patented internal-combustion flat engine, called boxermotor. During years nineteenth century, Benz largest car company 572 units produced 1899 and, size, Benz & Cie., joint-stock company. The motor car central Europe factory-made cars world, produced Czech company Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau (later renamed Tatra) 1897, Präsident automobil.Daimler Maybach founded Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG) Cannstatt 1890, sold car 1892 brand Daimler. It horse-drawn stagecoach built manufacturer, retrofitted engine design. By 1895 30 vehicles built Daimler Maybach, Daimler works Hotel Hermann, set shop disputes backers. Benz, Maybach Daimler team unaware other's work. They worked together; merger companies, Daimler Maybach longer DMG. Daimler died 1900 year, Maybach designed engine named Daimler-Mercedes ordered model built specifications set Emil Jellinek. This production small number vehicles Jellinek race market country. Two years later, 1902, model DMG car produced model named Mercedes Maybach engine, generated 35 hp. Maybach DMG shortly opened business own. Rights Daimler brand sold manufacturers.Karl Benz proposed co-operation DMG Benz & Cie. economic conditions began deteriorate Germany First World War, directors DMG refused consider initially. Negotiations companies resumed years conditions worsened and, 1924 signed Agreement Mutual Interest, valid year 2000. Both enterprises standardized design, production, purchasing, sales advertised marketed car models jointly, keeping brands. On 28 June 1926, Benz & Cie. DMG finally merged Daimler-Benz company, baptizing cars Mercedes Benz, brand honoring model DMG cars, Maybach design referred 1902 Mercedes-35 hp, Benz name. Karl Benz remained member board directors Daimler-Benz death 1929, sons participated management company.In 1890, Émile Levassor Armand Peugeot France began producing vehicles Daimler engines, laid foundation automotive industry France. In 1891, Auguste Doriot Peugeot colleague Louis Rigoulot completed longest trip gasoline-powered vehicle self-designed built Daimler powered Peugeot Type 3 completed 2,100 (1,300 miles) Valentigney Paris Brest again. They attached Paris–Brest–Paris bicycle race, finished 6 days winning cyclist, Charles Terront.The design American car gasoline internal combustion engine 1877 George Selden Rochester, New York. Selden applied patent car 1879, patent application expired vehicle built. After delay sixteen years series attachments application, 5 November 1895, Selden granted United States patent (U.S. Patent 549,160) two-stroke car engine, hindered, encouraged, development cars United States. His patent challenged Henry Ford others, overturned 1911.In 1893, running, gasoline-powered American car built road-tested Duryea brothers Springfield, Massachusetts. The public Duryea Motor Wagon 21 September 1893, Taylor Street Metro Center Springfield. The Studebaker Automobile Company, subsidiary long-established wagon coach manufacturer, started build cars 1897 commenced sales electric vehicles 1902 gasoline vehicles 1904.In Britain, attempts build steam cars varying degrees success, Thomas Rickett attempting production 1860. Santler Malvern recognized Veteran Car Club Great Britain gasoline-powered car country 1894, Frederick William Lanchester 1895, one-offs. The production vehicles Great Britain Daimler Company, company founded Harry J. Lawson 1896, purchasing engines. Lawson's company car 1897, bore Daimler.In 1892, German engineer Rudolf Diesel granted patent "New Rational Combustion Engine". In 1897, built diesel engine. Steam-, electric-, gasoline-powered vehicles competed decades, gasoline internal combustion engines achieving dominance 1910s. Although pistonless rotary engine designs attempted compete conventional piston crankshaft design, Mazda's version Wankel engine limited success. Mass production The large-scale, production-line manufacturing affordable cars debuted Ransom Olds 1901 Oldsmobile factory located Lansing, Michigan based stationary assembly techniques pioneered Marc Isambard Brunel Portsmouth Block Mills, England, 1802. The assembly style mass production interchangeable parts pioneered U.S. Thomas Blanchard 1821, Springfield Armory Springfield, Massachusetts. This concept greatly expanded Henry Ford, 1913 world's moving assembly cars Highland Park Ford Plant.As result, Ford's cars fifteen-minute intervals, faster methods, increasing productivity eightfold, manpower (from 12.5-man-hours 1 hour 33 minutes). It successful, paint bottleneck. Only Japan Black dry fast enough, forcing company drop variety colors 1913, fast-drying Duco lacquer developed 1926. This source Ford's apocryphal remark, "any color black". In 1914, assembly worker buy Model T months' pay.Ford's complex safety procedures—especially assigning worker location allowing roam about—dramatically reduced rate injury. The combination high wages high efficiency called "Fordism," copied major industries. The efficiency assembly coincided economic United States. The assembly forced workers work pace repetitive motions led output worker countries productive methods.In automotive industry, dominating, spread worldwide founding Ford France Ford Britain 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany 1925; 1921, Citroen native European manufacturer production method. Soon, companies assembly lines, risk going broke; 1930, 250 companies not, disappeared.Development automotive technology rapid, hundreds small manufacturers competing world's attention. Key developments included electric ignition electric self-starter (both Charles Kettering, Cadillac Motor Company 1910–1911), independent suspension, four-wheel brakes.Since 1920s, cars mass-produced meet market needs, marketing plans heavily influenced car design. It Alfred P. Sloan established idea cars produced company, called General Motors Companion Make Program, buyers "move up" fortunes improved.Reflecting rapid pace change, shared parts larger production volume lower costs price range. For example, 1930s, LaSalles, sold Cadillac, cheaper mechanical parts Oldsmobile; 1950s, Chevrolet shared hood, doors, roof, windows Pontiac; 1990s, corporate powertrains shared platforms (with interchangeable brakes, suspension, parts) common. Even so, major makers afford high costs, companies decades production, Apperson, Cole, Dorris, Haynes, Premier, manage: American car makers existence 1920, 43 survived 1930, Great Depression, 1940, 17 left.In Europe, happen. Morris set production Cowley 1924, outsold Ford, 1923 Ford's practice vertical integration, buying Hotchkiss (engines), Wrigley (gearboxes), Osberton (radiators), instance, well competitors, Wolseley: 1925, Morris 41% total British car production. Most British small-car assemblers, Abbey Xtra, under. Citroen France, cars 1919; cheap cars reply Renault's 10CV Peugeot's 5CV, produced 550,000 cars 1925, Mors, Hurtu, compete. Germany's mass-manufactured car, Opel 4PS Laubfrosch (Tree Frog), Russelsheim 1924, making Opel car builder Germany, 37.5% market.In Japan, car production limited World War II. Only handful companines producing vehicles limited numbers, small, three-wheeled commercial uses, Daihatsu, partnering European companies, Isuzu building Wolseley A-9 1922. Mitsubishi partnered Fiat built Mitsubishi Model A based Fiat vehicle. Toyota, Nissan, Suzuki, Mazda, Honda began companies producing non-automotive products war, switching car production 1950s. Kiichiro Toyoda's decision Toyoda Loom Works automobile manufacturing create eventually Toyota Motor Corporation, largest automobile manufacturer world. Subaru, meanwhile, formed conglomerate companies banded Fuji Heavy Industries, broken keiretsu legislation. Fuel propulsion technologies Most cars today propelled internal combustion engine, fueled deflagration gasoline diesel. Both fuels air pollution blamed contributing climate change global warming. Rapidly increasing oil prices, concerns oil dependence, tightening environmental laws restrictions greenhouse gas emissions propelling work alternative power systems cars. Efforts improve replace existing technologies include development hybrid vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles hydrogen vehicles. Vehicles alternative fuels ethanol flexible-fuel vehicles natural gas vehicles gaining popularity countries. Cars racing speed records employed jet rocket engines, impractical common use.Oil consumption twentieth twenty-first centuries abundantly pushed car growth; 1985–2003 oil glut fuelled sales low-economy vehicles OECD countries. The BRIC countries adding consumption; December 2009 China largest car market. User interface Cars equipped controls driving, passenger comfort safety, operated combination feet hands, occasionally voice 2000s-era cars. These controls include steering wheel, pedals operating brakes controlling car's speed (and, manual transmission car, clutch pedal), shift lever stick changing gears, number buttons dials turning lights, ventilation functions. Modern cars' controls standardised, location accelerator brake, case. Controls evolving response technologies, example electric car integration mobile communications.Since car invented, controls fewer simpler automation. For example, cars manual controls choke valve, clutch, ignition timing, crank electric starter. However controls vehicles, making complex. Examples include air conditioning, navigation systems, car entertainment. Another trend replacement physical knob switches secondary controls touchscreen controls BMW's iDrive Ford's MyFord Touch. Another change cars' pedals physically linked brake mechanism throttle, 2010s, cars increasingly replaced physical linkages electronic controls. Lighting Cars typically fitted multiple types lights. These include headlights, illuminate ahead car visible users, vehicle night; jurisdictions, daytime running lights; brake lights indicate brakes applied; amber turn signal lights indicate turn intentions driver; white-coloured reverse lights illuminate area car (and indicate driver reversing); vehicles, additional lights (e.g., marker lights) increase visibility car. Interior lights ceiling car fitted driver passengers. Some vehicles trunk and, rarely, engine compartment light. Weight In United States, "from 1975 1980, average [car] weight dropped 1,842 1,464 (4,060 3,228 lb), response rising gasoline prices" fuel efficiency standards. The average car weighed 1,461 (3,221 lb) 1987 1,818 (4,009 lb) 2010, modern steel safety cages, anti-lock brakes, airbags, "more-powerful—if more-efficient—engines." Heavier cars safer driver, accident perspective, dangerous vehicles road users. The weight car influences fuel consumption performance, weight increased fuel consumption decreased performance. The SmartFortwo, small city car, weighs 750–795 (1,655–1,755 lb). Heavier cars include full-size cars, SUVs extended-length SUVs Suburban.According conducted Julian Allwood University Cambridge, global energy heavily reduced lighter cars, average weight 500 (1,100 lb) well achievable. In competitions Shell Eco Marathon, average car weights 45 (99 lb) achieved. These cars single-seaters (still falling definition car, 4-seater cars common), demonstrate amount car weights reduced, subsequent lower fuel (i.e. fuel 2560 km/l). Seating style Most cars designed carry multiple occupants, seats. Cars seats typically seat passengers front three rear. Full-size cars sport utility vehicles carry six, seven, occupants depending arrangement seats. In hand, sports cars designed seats. The differing passenger capacity luggage cargo space availability variety styles meet individual consumer requirements include, others, sedan/saloon, hatchback, station wagon/estate, minivan. Safety Road traffic accidents largest injury-related deaths worldwide. Mary Ward documented car fatalities 1869 Parsonstown, Ireland, Henry Bliss United States' pedestrian car casualties 1899 New York City. There standard tests safety cars, EuroNCAP US NCAP tests, insurance-industry-backed tests Insurance Institute Highway Safety (IIHS).Worldwide, road traffic safer, efforts government implement safety features cars (e.g., seat belts, air bags, etc.), reduce unsafe driving practices (e.g., speeding, drinking driving texting driving) road design safe adding features speed bumps, reduce vehicle speed, roundabouts, reduce likelihood head-on-collision (as compared intersection). Costs benefits The costs car usage, include cost of: acquiring vehicle, repairs auto maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, insurance, weighed cost alternatives, benefits – perceived – vehicle usage. The benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence convenience. During 1920s, cars benefit: "[c]ouples finally head unchaperoned dates, private space snuggle close night."Similarly costs society encompassing car use, include of: maintaining roads, land use, air pollution, road congestion, public health, health care, disposing vehicle life, balanced benefits society car generates. The societal benefits include: economy benefits, job wealth creation, car production maintenance, transportation provision, society wellbeing derived leisure travel opportunities, revenue generation tax opportunities. The ability humans move flexibly far-reaching implications nature societies. Environmental impact While types fuel power cars, gasoline diesel. The United States Environmental Protection Agency average vehicle emits 8,887 grams carbon dioxide gallon gasoline. The average vehicle running diesel fuel emit 10,180 grams carbon dioxide. Many governments fiscal policies (such road tax US gas guzzler tax) influence vehicle purchase decisions, CO2 figure reduced taxation. Fuel taxes incentive production efficient, polluting, car designs (e.g. hybrid vehicles) development alternative fuels. High fuel taxes incentive consumers purchase lighter, smaller, fuel-efficient cars, drive. On average, today's cars 75 percent recyclable, recycled steel helps reduce energy pollution. In United States Congress, federally mandated fuel efficiency standards debated regularly, passenger car standards risen 27.5 miles US gallon (8.6 L/100 km; 33.0 mpg‑imp) standard set 1985. Light truck standards changed frequently, set 22.2 miles US gallon (10.6 L/100 km; 26.7 mpg‑imp) 2007.The manufacture vehicles resource intensive, manufacturers report environmental performance factories, including energy usage, waste water consumption.The growth popularity car allowed cities sprawl, encouraging travel car inactivity obesity, turn lead increased risk variety diseases.Transportation (of types including trucks, buses cars) major contributor air pollution industrialised nations. According American Surface Transportation Policy Project half Americans breathing unhealthy air. Their study air quality dozens metropolitan areas worsened decade.Animals plants negatively impacted cars habitat destruction pollution. Over lifetime average car "loss habitat potential" 50,000 m2 (540,000 sq ft) based primary production correlations. Animals killed year roads cars, referred roadkill. More road developments including environmental mitigations designs green bridges allow wildlife crossings, creating wildlife corridors.Growth popularity vehicles commuting led traffic congestion. Brussels considered Europe's congested city 2011 TomTom. Emerging car technologies Car propulsion technologies development include gasoline/electric plug-in hybrids, battery electric vehicles, hydrogen cars, biofuels, alternative fuels. Research future alternative forms power include development fuel cells, Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI), Stirling engines, stored energy compressed air liquid nitrogen.New materials replace steel car bodies include duralumin, fiberglass, carbon fiber, carbon nanotubes. Telematics technology allowing people share cars, pay-as-you-go basis, car share carpool schemes. Communication evolving connected car systems. Autonomous car Fully autonomous vehicles, driverless cars, exist prototype (such Google driverless car), expected commercially 2020. According urban designer futurist Michael E. Arth, driverless electric vehicles—in conjunction increased virtual reality work, travel, pleasure—could reduce world's 800 vehicles fraction number decades. This private cars requiring drivers, parked 90% time, traded public self-driving taxis constant use. This allow appropriate vehicle need—a bus group people, limousine night out, Segway short trip street person. Children chauffeured supervised safety, DUIs longer exist, 41,000 lives saved year US alone. Open source development There projects aiming develop car principles open design, approach designing plans machinery systems publicly shared, monetary compensation. The projects include OScar, Riversimple (through 40fires.org) c,mm,n.

Establishment modern codes English public schools While football continued played forms Britain, public schools (known private schools countries) credited achievements creation modern football codes. First all, evidence suggests football "mob" turning organised team sport. Second, descriptions football references recorded people studied schools. Third, teachers, students students schools codified football games, enable matches played schools. Finally, English public schools division "kicking" "running" (or "carrying") games clear.The earliest evidence games resembling football played English public schools – attended boys upper, upper-middle professional classes – Vulgaria William Herman 1519.

The codes – sense set rules – Eton 1815 Aldenham 1825.)During 19th century, working class people Britain work days week, twelve hours day. They inclination engage sport recreation and, time, children labour force. Feast day football played streets decline. Public school boys, enjoyed freedom work, inventors organised football games formal codes rules.Football number public schools encouraging competitiveness keeping youths fit. Each school drafted rules, varied schools changed intake pupils. Two schools thought developed rules.

Australian rules There archival evidence "foot-ball" games played parts Australia half 19th century. The origins organised game football today Australian rules football traced 1858 Melbourne, capital city Victoria.In July 1858, Tom Wills, Australian-born cricketer educated Rugby School England, wrote letter Bell's Life Victoria & Sporting Chronicle, calling "foot-ball club" "code laws" cricketers fit winter. This considered historians defining moment creation Australian rules football. Through publicity personal contacts Wills co-ordinate football matches Melbourne experimented rules, played July 31, 1858. One week later, Wills umpired schoolboys match Melbourne Grammar School Scotch College. Following matches, organised football Melbourne rapidly increased popularity.Wills involved matches formed Melbourne Football Club (the oldest surviving Australian football club) May 14, 1859. Club members Wills, William Hammersley, J. B. Thompson Thomas H. Smith intention forming set rules clubs. The committee debated rules English public school games; Wills pushed rugby football rules learnt schooling. The rules share similarities games, shaped suit Australian conditions. H. C. A. Harrison, seminal figure Australian football, recalled cousin Wills wanted "a game own". The code distinctive prevalence mark, free kick, tackling, lack offside rule players penalised throwing ball.The Melbourne football rules distributed gradually Victorian clubs. The rules updated 1860s accommodate rules influential Victorian football clubs. A redraft 1866 H. C. A.

It cricket fields oval ball, specialised goal posts, featured bouncing ball running spectacular high marking. The game spread Australian colonies. Outside heartland southern Australia code experienced period decline World War I grown Australia parts world, Australian Football League emerged professional competition. Football Association During 1860s, increasing attempts England unify reconcile public school games. In 1862, J. C. Thring, driving forces original Cambridge Rules, master Uppingham School issued rules called "The Simplest Game" (these Uppingham Rules). In October 1863 revised version Cambridge Rules drawn member committee representing pupils Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough Westminster.At Freemasons' Tavern, Great Queen Street, London evening October 26, 1863, representatives football clubs London Metropolitan area inaugural meeting The Football Association (FA). The aim Association establish single unifying code regulate playing game members. Following meeting, public schools invited join association. All declined, Charterhouse Uppingham. In total, meetings FA held October December 1863. After third meeting, draft set rules published. However, fourth meeting, attention drawn published Cambridge Rules 1863. The Cambridge rules differed draft FA rules areas; running (carrying) ball hacking (kicking opposing players shins). The contentious FA rules follows:IX. A player entitled ball adversaries' goal fair catch, catches ball bound; case fair catch, mark run.X. If player ball adversaries' goal, player opposite liberty charge, hold, trip hack him, wrest ball him, player held hacked time.At meeting proposed rules removed. Most delegates supported this, F. M. Campbell, representative Blackheath FA treasurer, objected. He said: "hacking true football". However, motion ban running ball hacking carried Blackheath withdrew FA. After final meeting 8 December, FA published "Laws Football", comprehensive set rules game Association Football. The term "soccer", 19th century, derives Oxford University abbreviation "Association".The FA rules contained elements longer association football, recognisable games (such Australian football rugby football): instance, player fair catch claim mark, entitled free kick; player touched ball opponents' goal line, entitled free kick goal, 15 yards (13.5 metres) front goal line. Rugby football In Britain, 1870, 75 clubs playing variations Rugby school game. There "rugby" clubs Ireland, Australia, Canada New Zealand. However, generally accepted set rules rugby 1871, 21 clubs London Rugby Football Union (RFU). The official RFU rules June 1871. These rules allowed passing ball. They included try, touching ball allowed attempt goal, drop-goals marks general play, penalty conversions contest. North American football codes As case Britain, 19th century, North American schools universities played local games, students. For example, students Dartmouth College New Hampshire played game called Old division football, variant association football codes, 1820s. They remained "mob football" style games, huge numbers players attempting advance ball goal area, necessary. Rules simple, violence injury common. The violence mob-style games led widespread protests decision abandon them. Yale University, pressure city New Haven, banned play forms football 1860, Harvard University suit 1861. In place, general types football evolved: "kicking" games "running" (or "carrying") games. A hybrid two, "Boston game", played group Oneida Football Club. The club, considered historians formal football club United States, formed 1862 schoolboys played "Boston game" Boston Common. The game began return American college campuses 1860s. The universities Yale, Princeton (then College New Jersey), Rutgers, Brown began playing "kicking" games time. In 1867, Princeton rules based English Football Association.In Canada, documented football match practice game played November 9, 1861, University College, University Toronto (approximately 400 yards west Queen's Park). One participants game involving University Toronto students (Sir) William Mulock, Chancellor school. In 1864, Trinity College, Toronto, F. Barlow Cumberland, Frederick A. Bethune, Christopher Gwynn, founders Milton, Massachusetts, devised rules based rugby football. A "running game", resembling rugby football, Montreal Football Club Canada 1868.On November 6, 1869, Rutgers faced Princeton game played ball and, games, improvised rules. It regarded game American intercollegiate football.Modern North American football grew match McGill University Montreal, Harvard University 1874. During game, teams alternated rugby-based rules McGill Boston Game rules Harvard. Within years, Harvard McGill's rules persuaded U.S. university teams same. On November 23, 1876, representatives Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia Massasoit Convention Springfield, Massachusetts, agreeing Rugby Football Union rules, variations.In 1880, Yale coach Walter Camp, fixture Massasoit House conventions rules debated changed, devised number major innovations. Camp's rule changes diverged American game rugby replacing scrummage scrimmage establishment down-and-distance rules. American football remained violent sport collisions led serious injuries death. This led U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt hold meeting football representatives Harvard, Yale, Princeton October 9, 1905, urging drastic changes. One rule change introduced 1906, devised open game reduce injury, introduction legal forward pass. Though underutilised years, proved rule changes establishment modern game.Over years, Canada absorbed developments American football effort distinguish rugby-oriented game. In 1903, Ontario Rugby Football Union Burnside rules, implemented scrimmage down-and-distance system American football, others. Canadian football implemented legal forward pass 1929. American Canadian football remain codes, stemming rule changes American border Canadian not. Gaelic football In mid-19th century, traditional football games, referred collectively caid, remained popular Ireland, County Kerry. One observer, Father W. Ferris, described forms caid period: "field game" object ball arch-like goals, formed boughs trees; epic "cross-country game" daylight hours Sunday played, team ball parish boundary. "Wrestling", "holding" opposing players, carrying ball allowed.By 1870s, Rugby Association football started popular Ireland. Trinity College, Dublin stronghold Rugby (see Developments 1850s section, above). The rules English FA distributed widely. Traditional forms caid begun "rough-and-tumble game" allowed tripping.There serious attempt unify codify Irish varieties football, establishment Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) 1884. The GAA sought promote traditional Irish sports, hurling reject imported games Rugby Association football. The Gaelic football rules drawn Maurice Davin published United Ireland magazine February 7, 1887. Davin's rules influence games hurling desire formalise distinctly Irish code football. The prime example differentiation lack offside rule (an attribute which, years, shared Irish games hurling, Australian rules football). Schism Rugby football The International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) founded 1886, rifts emerge code. Professionalism began creep codes football.In England, 1890s, long-standing Rugby Football Union ban professional players causing regional tensions rugby football, players northern England working class afford train, travel, play recover injuries. This occurred years earlier soccer Northern England authorities reacted differently RFU, attempting alienate working class support Northern England. In 1895, dispute player paid broken payments, replaced wages lost playing rugby, representatives northern clubs Huddersfield Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU). The initially permitted types player wage replacements. However, years, NRFU players paid, required job sport.The demands professional league dictated rugby better "spectator" sport. Within years NRFU rules started diverge RFU, notably abolition line-out. This replacement ruck "play-the-ball ruck", allowed two-player ruck contest tackler marker player tackled. Mauls stopped ball carrier held, replaced play-the ball-ruck. The separate Lancashire Yorkshire competitions NRFU merged 1901, forming Northern Rugby League, rugby league officially England.Over time, RFU rugby, played clubs remained members national federations affiliated IRFB, rugby union. Globalisation association football The single oversee association football 20th century, increasing popularity international fixtures. The English Football Association chaired discussions setting international body, perceived making progress. It fell associations European countries: France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, international association. The Fédération Internationale Football Association (FIFA) founded Paris May 21, 1904. Its president Robert Guérin. The French acronym remained, French-speaking countries. Further divergence rugby codes Rugby league rules diverged rugby union 1906, reduction team 15 13 players. In 1907, New Zealand professional rugby team toured Australia Britain, receiving enthusiastic response, professional rugby leagues launched Australia year. However, rules professional games varied country another, negotiations national bodies required exact rules international match. This situation endured 1948, instigation French league, Rugby League International Federation (RLIF) formed meeting Bordeaux.During second half 20th century, rules changed further. In 1966, rugby league officials borrowed American football concept downs: team allowed retain possession ball tackles (rugby union retains original rule player tackled brought ground release ball immediately). The maximum number tackles increased (in 1971), rugby league tackle rule.With advent full-time professionals 1990s, consequent speeding game, metre off-side distance teams 10 metres, replacement rule superseded interchange rules, changes.The laws rugby union changed 20th century, rugby league. In particular, goals marks abolished, kicks directly touch 22 metre penalised, laws determine possession inconclusive ruck maul, lifting players line-outs legalised.In 1995, rugby union "open" game, allowed professional players. Although original dispute codes disappeared – despite fact officials forms rugby football mentioned possibility re-unification – rules codes culture diverged extent event foreseeable future. Use "football" The "football", reference game described above. Because this, friendly controversy occurred term football, parts English-speaking world. Most often, "football" refer code football considered region. So, effectively, "football" depends it.In United Kingdom, United States, Canada, football code solely "football", generally require qualifier. In New Zealand, "football" historically referred rugby union, unqualified refer association football. The sport "football" Australia Australian rules football rugby league, depending popularity (which conforms called Barassi Line). In francophone Quebec, Canadian football popular, Canadian code football American football Football américain association football soccer. Of 45 national FIFA (Fédération Internationale Football Association) affiliates English official primary language, currently Football organisations' official names; FIFA affiliates Canada United States Soccer names. A FIFA affiliates "normalised" "Football", including:Australia's association football governing changed 2005 "soccer" "football"New Zealand's governing changed 2007, "the international game called football."Samoa changed "Samoa Football (Soccer) Federation" "Football Federation Samoa" 2009.

Microeconomics examines behaviour basic elements economy, including individual agents markets, interactions, outcomes interactions. Individual agents include, example, households, firms, buyers, sellers. Macroeconomics analyzes entire economy (meaning aggregated production, consumption, savings, investment) issues it, including unemployment resources (labour, capital, land), inflation, economic growth, public policies address issues (monetary, fiscal, policies).Other broad distinctions economics include positive economics, describing "what is", normative economics, advocating "what be"; economic theory applied economics; rational behavioural economics; mainstream economics heterodox economics.Economic analysis applied society, business, finance, health care, government. Economic analyses applied diverse subjects crime, education, family, law, politics, religion, social institutions, war, science, environment. Education, example, requires time, effort, expenses, foregone income experience, losses weighted future benefits education bring agent economy. At turn 21st century, expanding domain economics social sciences described economic imperialism. The ultimate goal economics improve living conditions people everyday life. Definitions There variety modern definitions economics. Some differences reflect evolving views subject views economists. Scottish philosopher Adam Smith (1776) defined called political economy "an inquiry nature wealth nations", as:a branch science statesman legislator [with twofold objectives providing] plentiful revenue subsistence people ... [and] supply commonwealth revenue publick services.J.-B. Say (1803), distinguishing subject public-policy uses, defines science production, distribution, consumption wealth. On satirical side, Thomas Carlyle (1849) coined "the dismal science" epithet classical economics, context, commonly linked pessimistic analysis Malthus (1798). John Stuart Mill (1844) defines subject social context as:The science traces laws phenomena society combined operations mankind production wealth, phenomena modified pursuit object.Alfred Marshall cited definition textbook Principles Economics (1890) extends analysis wealth societal microeconomic level:Economics study ordinary business life. It enquires income it. Thus, side, study wealth side, study man.Lionel Robbins (1932) developed implications termed "[p]erhaps commonly accepted current definition subject":Economics science studies human behaviour relationship scarce alternative uses.Robbins describes definition classificatory "pick[ing] kinds behaviour" analytical "focus[ing] attention aspect behaviour, imposed influence scarcity." He affirmed economists centred studies analysis wealth: wealth created (production), distributed, consumed; wealth grow. But economics study things, war, focus. This goal winning (as sought end), generates cost benefits; and, resources (human life costs) attain goal. If winnable expected costs outweigh benefits, deciding actors (assuming rational) (a decision) explore alternatives. We define economics science studies wealth, war, crime, education, field economic analysis applied to; but, science studies common aspect subjects (they scarce resources attain sought end).Some subsequent comments criticized definition overly broad failing limit subject matter analysis markets. From 1960s, however, comments abated economic theory maximizing behaviour rational-choice modelling expanded domain subject areas treated fields. There criticisms well, scarcity accounting macroeconomics high unemployment.Gary Becker, contributor expansion economics areas, describes approach favours "combin[ing the] assumptions maximizing behaviour, stable preferences, market equilibrium, relentlessly unflinchingly." One commentary characterizes remark making economics approach subject matter great specificity "choice process type social interaction [such] analysis involves." The source reviews range definitions included principles economics textbooks concludes lack agreement subject-matter texts treat. Among economists generally, argues definition presented reflect direction author believes economics evolving, evolve. Microeconomics Markets Microeconomics examines entities, forming market structure, interact market create market system. These entities include private public players classifications, typically operating scarcity tradable units government regulation. The item traded tangible product apples service repair services, legal counsel, entertainment.In theory, free market aggregates (sum of) quantity demanded buyers quantity supplied sellers equal reach economic equilibrium reaction price changes; practice, issues prevent equilibrium, equilibrium reached morally equitable. For example, supply healthcare services limited external factors, equilibrium price unaffordable desire pay it.Various market structures exist. In perfectly competitive markets, participants market power set price homogeneous product. In words, participant "price taker" participant influences price product. In world, markets experience imperfect competition.Forms include monopoly (in seller good), duopoly (in sellers good), oligopoly (in sellers good), monopolistic competition (in sellers producing highly differentiated goods), monopsony (in buyer good), oligopsony (in buyers good). Unlike perfect competition, imperfect competition invariably market power unequally distributed. Firms imperfect competition "price makers", that, holding disproportionately high share market power, influence prices products.Microeconomics studies individual markets simplifying economic system assuming activity market analysed markets. This method analysis partial-equilibrium analysis (supply demand). This method aggregates (the sum activity) market. General-equilibrium theory studies markets behaviour. It aggregates (the sum activity) markets. This method studies changes markets interactions leading equilibrium. Production, cost, efficiency In microeconomics, production conversion inputs outputs. It economic process inputs create commodity service exchange direct use. Production flow rate output period time. Distinctions include production alternatives consumption (food, haircuts, etc.) vs. investment goods (new tractors, buildings, roads, etc.), public goods (national defence, smallpox vaccinations, etc.) private goods (new computers, bananas, etc.), "guns" "butter".Opportunity cost refers economic cost production: best opportunity foregone. Choices desirable mutually exclusive actions. It described expressing "the basic relationship scarcity choice". For example, baker sack flour pretzels morning, baker flour morning bagels instead. Part cost making pretzels flour morning longer, way. The opportunity cost activity element ensuring scarce resources efficiently, cost weighed activity deciding it. Opportunity costs restricted monetary financial costs measured cost output forgone, leisure, alternative benefit (utility).Inputs production process include primary factors production labour services, capital (durable produced goods production, existing factory), land (including natural resources). Other inputs include intermediate goods production final goods, steel car.Economic efficiency describes well system generates desired output set inputs technology. Efficiency improved output generated changing inputs, words, amount "waste" reduced. A accepted general standard Pareto efficiency, reached change better making worse off.The production–possibility frontier (PPF) expository figure representing scarcity, cost, efficiency. In simplest case economy produce goods (say "guns" "butter"). The PPF table graph (as right) showing quantity combinations goods producible technology total factor inputs, limit feasible total output. Each point curve total output economy, maximum feasible output good, feasible output quantity good.Scarcity represented figure people unable aggregate consume PPF (such X) negative slope curve. If production good increases curve, production good decreases, inverse relationship. This increasing output good requires transferring inputs production good, decreasing latter.The slope curve point trade-off goods. It measures additional unit good costs units forgone good, example opportunity cost. Thus, Gun costs 100 units butter, opportunity cost Gun 100 Butter. Along PPF, scarcity implies choosing good aggregate entails good. Still, market economy, movement curve indicate choice increased output anticipated worth cost agents.By construction, point curve productive efficiency maximizing output total inputs. A point inside curve (as A), feasible represents production inefficiency (wasteful inputs), output goods increase moving northeast direction point curve. Examples cited inefficiency include high unemployment business-cycle recession economic organization country discourages resources. Being curve satisfy allocative efficiency (also called Pareto efficiency) produce mix goods consumers prefer points.Much applied economics public policy concerned determining efficiency economy improved. Recognizing reality scarcity figuring organize society efficient resources described "essence economics", subject "makes unique contribution." Specialization Specialization considered economic efficiency based theoretical empirical considerations. Different individuals nations opportunity costs production, differences stocks human capital worker capital/labour ratios. According theory, comparative advantage production goods intensive abundant, cheaper, input.Even region absolute advantage ratio outputs inputs type output, specialize output comparative advantage trading region lacks absolute advantage comparative advantage producing else.It observed high volume trade occurs regions access technology mix factor inputs, including high-income countries. This led investigation economies scale agglomeration explain specialization differentiated product lines, benefit trading parties regions.The general theory specialization applies trade individuals, farms, manufacturers, service providers, economies. Among production systems, corresponding division labour work groups specializing, correspondingly types capital equipment differentiated land uses.An example combines features country specializes production high-tech knowledge products, developed countries do, trades developing nations goods produced factories labour cheap plentiful, opportunity costs production. More total output utility specializing production trading country produced high-tech low-tech products.Theory observation set conditions market prices outputs productive inputs select allocation factor inputs comparative advantage, (relatively) low-cost inputs producing low-cost outputs. In process, aggregate output increase by-product design. Such specialization production creates opportunities trade resource owners benefit trade sale type output other, highly valued goods. A measure trade increased income levels trade facilitate. Supply demand Prices quantities described directly observable attributes goods produced exchanged market economy. The theory supply demand organizing principle explaining prices coordinate amounts produced consumed. In microeconomics, applies price output determination market perfect competition, includes condition buyers sellers price-setting power.For market commodity, demand relation quantity buyers prepared purchase unit price good. Demand represented table graph showing price quantity demanded (as figure). Demand theory describes individual consumers rationally choosing preferred quantity good, income, prices, tastes, etc. A term "constrained utility maximization" (with income wealth constraints demand). Here, utility refers hypothesized relation individual consumer ranking commodity bundles preferred.The law demand that, general, price quantity demanded market inversely related. That is, higher price product, people prepared buy (other things unchanged). As price commodity falls, consumers move expensive goods (the substitution effect). In addition, purchasing power price decline increases ability buy (the income effect). Other factors change demand; example increase income shift demand curve good outward origin, figure. All determinants constant factors demand supply.Supply relation price good quantity sale price. It represented table graph relating price quantity supplied. Producers, example business firms, hypothesized profit-maximizers, meaning attempt produce supply amount goods bring highest profit. Supply typically represented function relating price quantity, factors unchanged.That is, higher price good sold, producers supply, figure. The higher price profitable increase production. Just demand side, position supply shift, change price productive input technical improvement. The "Law Supply" that, general, price leads expansion supply fall price leads contraction supply. Here well, determinants supply, price substitutes, cost production, technology applied factors inputs production constant period evaluation supply.Market equilibrium occurs quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, intersection supply demand curves figure above. At price equilibrium, shortage quantity supplied compared quantity demanded. This posited bid price up. At price equilibrium, surplus quantity supplied compared quantity demanded. This pushes price down. The model supply demand predicts supply demand curves, price quantity stabilize price quantity supplied equal quantity demanded. Similarly, demand-and-supply theory predicts price-quantity combination shift demand (as figure), supply.For quantity consumer good, point demand curve indicates value, marginal utility, consumers unit. It measures consumer prepared pay unit. The corresponding point supply curve measures marginal cost, increase total cost supplier corresponding unit good. The price equilibrium determined supply demand. In perfectly competitive market, supply demand equate marginal cost marginal utility equilibrium.On supply market, factors production described (relatively) variable short run, cost changing output levels. Their usage rates changed easily, electrical power, raw-material inputs, over-time temp work. Other inputs fixed, plant equipment personnel. In run, inputs adjusted management. These distinctions translate differences elasticity (responsiveness) supply curve short runs corresponding differences price-quantity change shift supply demand market.Marginalist theory, above, describes consumers attempting reach most-preferred positions, subject income wealth constraints producers attempt maximize profits subject constraints, including demand goods produced, technology, price inputs. For consumer, point marginal utility good, price, reaches zero, leaving consumption increases. Analogously, producer compares marginal revenue (identical price perfect competitor) marginal cost good, marginal profit difference. At point marginal profit reaches zero, increases production good stop. For movement market equilibrium changes equilibrium, price quantity change "at margin": more-or-less something, all-or-nothing.Other applications demand supply include distribution income factors production, including labour capital, factor markets. In competitive labour market example quantity labour employed price labour (the wage rate) depends demand labour (from employers production) supply labour (from workers). Labour economics examines interaction workers employers markets explain patterns changes wages labour income, labour mobility, (un)employment, productivity human capital, public-policy issues.Demand-and-supply analysis explain behaviour perfectly competitive markets, standard comparison extended type market. It generalized explain variables economy, example, total output (estimated GDP) general price level, studied macroeconomics. Tracing qualitative quantitative effects variables change supply demand, short run, standard exercise applied economics. Economic theory conditions supply demand market efficient mechanism allocating resources. Firms People frequently trade directly markets. Instead, supply side, work produce firms. The kinds firms corporations, partnerships trusts. According Ronald Coase, people organize production firms costs business lower market. Firms combine labour capital, achieve greater economies scale (when average cost unit declines units produced) individual market trading.In perfectly competitive markets studied theory supply demand, producers, influence price. Industrial organization generalizes case study strategic behaviour firms control price. It considers structure markets interactions. Common market structures studied perfect competition include monopolistic competition, forms oligopoly, monopoly.Managerial economics applies microeconomic analysis decisions business firms management units. It draws heavily quantitative methods operations programming statistical methods regression analysis absence certainty perfect knowledge. A unifying theme attempt optimize business decisions, including unit-cost minimization profit maximization, firm's objectives constraints imposed technology market conditions. Uncertainty game theory Uncertainty economics unknown prospect loss, quantifiable risk not. Without it, household behaviour unaffected uncertain employment income prospects, financial capital markets reduce exchange single instrument market period, communications industry. Given forms, representing uncertainty modelling economic agents' responses it.Game theory branch applied mathematics considers strategic interactions agents, kind uncertainty. It mathematical foundation industrial organization, discussed above, model types firm behaviour, example oligopolistic industry (few sellers), equally applicable wage negotiations, bargaining, contract design, situation individual agents perceptible effects other. As method heavily behavioural economics, postulates agents choose strategies maximize payoffs, strategies agents partially conflicting interests.In this, generalizes maximization approaches developed analyse market actors supply demand model allows incomplete actors. The field dates 1944 classic Theory Games Economic Behavior John von Neumann Oskar Morgenstern. It applications seemingly economics diverse subjects formulation nuclear strategies, ethics, political science, evolutionary biology.Risk aversion stimulate activity well-functioning markets smooths risk communicates risk, markets insurance, commodity futures contracts, financial instruments. Financial economics simply finance describes allocation financial resources. It analyses pricing financial instruments, financial structure companies, efficiency fragility financial markets, financial crises, government policy regulation.Some market organizations inefficiencies associated uncertainty. Based George Akerlof's "Market Lemons" article, paradigm example dodgy second-hand car market. Customers knowledge car "lemon" depress price quality second-hand car be. Information asymmetry arises here, seller relevant buyer incentive disclose it. Related problems insurance adverse selection, risk insure (say reckless drivers), moral hazard, insurance riskier behaviour (say reckless driving).Both problems raise insurance costs reduce efficiency driving transactors market ("incomplete markets"). Moreover, attempting reduce problem, adverse selection mandating insurance, another, moral hazard. Information economics, studies problems, relevance subjects insurance, contract law, mechanism design, monetary economics, health care. Applied subjects include market legal remedies spread reduce risk, warranties, government-mandated partial insurance, restructuring bankruptcy law, inspection, regulation quality disclosure. Market failure The term "market failure" encompasses problems undermine standard economic assumptions. Although economists categorize market failures differently, categories emerge texts.Information asymmetries incomplete markets economic inefficiency possibility improving efficiency market, legal, regulatory remedies, discussed above.Natural monopoly, overlapping concepts "practical" "technical" monopoly, extreme case failure competition restraint producers. Extreme economies scale cause.Public goods goods undersupplied typical market. The defining features people consume public goods pay person consume good time.Externalities occur social costs benefits production consumption reflected market prices. For example, air pollution generate negative externality, education generate positive externality (less crime, etc.). Governments tax restrict sale goods negative externalities subsidize promote purchase goods positive externalities effort correct price distortions caused externalities. Elementary demand-and-supply theory predicts equilibrium speed adjustment changes equilibrium shift demand supply.In areas, price stickiness postulated account quantities, prices, adjusting short changes demand supply side. This includes standard analysis business cycle macroeconomics. Analysis revolves price stickiness implications reaching hypothesized long-run equilibrium. Examples price stickiness markets include wage rates labour markets posted prices markets deviating perfect competition.Some specialized fields economics deal market failure others. The economics public sector example. Much environmental economics concerns externalities "public bads".Policy options include regulations reflect cost-benefit analysis market solutions change incentives, emission fees redefinition property rights. Public sector Public finance field economics deals budgeting revenues expenditures public sector entity, government. The subject addresses matters tax incidence (who pays tax), cost-benefit analysis government programmes, effects economic efficiency income distribution kinds spending taxes, fiscal politics. The latter, aspect public choice theory, models public-sector behaviour analogously microeconomics, involving interactions self-interested voters, politicians, bureaucrats.Much economics positive, seeking describe predict economic phenomena. Normative economics seeks identify economies like.Welfare economics normative branch economics microeconomic techniques simultaneously determine allocative efficiency economy income distribution associated it. It attempts measure social welfare examining economic activities individuals comprise society. Macroeconomics Macroeconomics examines economy explain broad aggregates interactions "top down", is, simplified general-equilibrium theory. Such aggregates include national income output, unemployment rate, price inflation subaggregates total consumption investment spending components. It studies effects monetary policy fiscal policy.Since 1960s, macroeconomics characterized integration micro-based modelling sectors, including rationality players, efficient market information, imperfect competition. This addressed long-standing concern inconsistent developments subject.Macroeconomic analysis considers factors long-term level growth national income. Such factors include capital accumulation, technological change labour force growth. Growth Growth economics studies factors explain economic growth – increase output capita country period time. The factors explain differences level output capita countries, countries grow faster others, countries converge rates growth.Much-studied factors include rate investment, population growth, technological change. These represented theoretical empirical forms (as neoclassical endogenous growth models) growth accounting. Business cycle The economics depression spur creation "macroeconomics" separate discipline field study. During Great Depression 1930s, John Maynard Keynes authored book entitled The General Theory Employment, Interest Money outlining theories Keynesian economics. Keynes contended aggregate demand goods insufficient economic downturns, leading unnecessarily high unemployment losses output.He advocated active policy responses public sector, including monetary policy actions central bank fiscal policy actions government stabilize output business cycle. Thus, central conclusion Keynesian economics that, situations, automatic mechanism moves output employment employment levels. John Hicks' IS/LM model influential interpretation The General Theory.Over years, understanding business cycle branched programmes, distinct Keynesianism. The neoclassical synthesis refers reconciliation Keynesian economics neoclassical economics, stating Keynesianism correct short qualified neoclassical-like considerations intermediate run.New classical macroeconomics, distinct Keynesian view business cycle, posits market clearing imperfect information. It includes Friedman's permanent income hypothesis consumption "rational expectations" theory, led Robert Lucas, business cycle theory.In contrast, Keynesian approach retains rational expectations assumption, assumes variety market failures. In particular, New Keynesians assume prices wages "sticky", adjust instantaneously changes economic conditions.Thus, classicals assume prices wages adjust automatically attain employment, Keynesians employment automatically achieved run, government central-bank policies needed "long run" long. Unemployment The amount unemployment economy measured unemployment rate, percentage workers jobs labour force. The labour force includes workers actively jobs. People retired, pursuing education, discouraged seeking work lack job prospects excluded labour force. Unemployment generally broken types causes.Classical models unemployment occurs wages high employers hire workers. Wages high minimum wage laws union activity. Consistent classical unemployment, frictional unemployment occurs appropriate job vacancies exist worker, length needed find job leads period unemployment.Structural unemployment covers variety unemployment including mismatch workers' skills skills required open jobs. Large amounts structural unemployment occur economy transitioning industries workers find set skills longer demand. Structural unemployment frictional unemployment reflect problem matching workers job vacancies, structural unemployment covers needed acquire skills short term process.While types unemployment occur condition economy, cyclical unemployment occurs growth stagnates. Okun's law represents empirical relationship unemployment economic growth. The original version Okun's law 3% increase output lead 1% decrease unemployment. Inflation monetary policy Money final payment goods price system economies unit account prices typically stated. An apt statement Francis Amasa Walker, well-known economist is, "Money money does." Money general acceptability, consistency value, divisibility, durability, portability, elastic supply survives mass public confidence. It includes currency held nonbank public checkable deposits. It described social convention, language, others.As medium exchange, money facilitates trade. It essentially measure importantly, store basis credit creation. Its economic function contrasted barter (non-monetary exchange). Given diverse array produced goods specialized producers, barter entail hard-to-locate double coincidence exchanged, apples book. Money reduce transaction cost exchange acceptability. Then costly seller accept money exchange, buyer produces.At level economy, theory evidence consistent positive relationship running total money supply nominal total output general price level. For reason, management money supply aspect monetary policy. Fiscal policy Governments implement fiscal policy influence macroeconomic conditions adjusting spending taxation policies alter aggregate demand. When aggregate demand falls output economy, output gap productive capacity left unemployed. Governments increase spending cut taxes boost aggregate demand. Resources idled government.For example, unemployed builders hired expand highways. Tax cuts allow consumers increase spending, boosts aggregate demand. Both tax cuts spending multiplier effects initial increase demand policy percolates economy generates additional economic activity.The effects fiscal policy limited crowding out. When output gap, economy producing capacity excess productive resources. If government increases spending situation, government resources private sector, increase output. Some economists crowding issue major issue output depressed.Sceptics fiscal policy argument Ricardian equivalence. They argue increase debt paid future tax increases, people reduce consumption save money pay future tax increase. Under Ricardian equivalence, boost demand fiscal policy offset increased savings rate intended pay future higher taxes. International economics International trade studies determinants goods-and-services flows international boundaries. It concerns size distribution trade. Policy applications include estimating effects changing tariff rates trade quotas. International finance macroeconomic field examines flow capital international borders, effects movements exchange rates. Increased trade goods, services capital countries major contemporary globalization.The distinct field development economics examines economic aspects economic development process low-income countries focusing structural change, poverty, economic growth. Approaches development economics frequently incorporate social political factors.Economic systems branch economics studies methods institutions societies determine ownership, direction, allocation economic resources. An economic system society unit analysis.Among contemporary systems organizational spectrum socialist systems capitalist systems, production occurs state-run private enterprises. In mixed economies. A common element interaction economic political influences, broadly described political economy. Comparative economic systems studies performance behaviour economies systems.The U.S. Export-Import Bank defines Marxist-Lenninist centrally planned economy. They rare, examples Cuba, North Korea Laos. Practice Contemporary economics mathematics. Economists draw tools calculus, linear algebra, statistics, game theory, computer science. Professional economists expected familiar tools, minority specialize econometrics mathematical methods. Theory Mainstream economic theory relies priori quantitative economic models, employ variety concepts. Theory typically proceeds assumption ceteris paribus, holding constant explanatory variables consideration. When creating theories, objective find simple requirements, precise predictions, fruitful generating additional prior theories.In microeconomics, principal concepts include supply demand, marginalism, rational choice theory, opportunity cost, budget constraints, utility, theory firm. Early macroeconomic models focused modeling relationships aggregate variables, relationships appeared change macroeconomists, including Keynesians, reformulated models microfoundations.The aforementioned microeconomic concepts play major macroeconomic models – instance, monetary theory, quantity theory money predicts increases money supply increase inflation, inflation assumed influenced rational expectations. In development economics, slower growth developed nations predicted declining marginal returns investment capital, observed Four Asian Tigers. Sometimes economic hypothesis qualitative, quantitative.Expositions economic reasoning two-dimensional graphs illustrate theoretical relationships. At higher level generality, Paul Samuelson's treatise Foundations Economic Analysis (1947) mathematical methods represent theory, maximizing behavioural relations agents reaching equilibrium. The book focused examining class statements called operationally meaningful theorems economics, theorems conceivably refuted empirical data. Empirical investigation Economic theories frequently tested empirically, econometrics economic data. The controlled experiments common physical sciences difficult uncommon economics, broad data observationally studied; type testing typically regarded rigorous controlled experimentation, conclusions typically tentative. However, field experimental economics growing, increasing natural experiments.Statistical methods regression analysis common. Practitioners methods estimate size, economic significance, statistical significance ("signal strength") hypothesized relation(s) adjust noise variables. By means, hypothesis acceptance, probabilistic, certain, sense. Acceptance dependent falsifiable hypothesis surviving tests. Use commonly accepted methods produce final conclusion consensus question, tests, data sets, prior beliefs.Criticism based professional standards non-replicability serve checks bias, errors, over-generalization, economic accused non-replicable, prestigious journals accused facilitating replication provision code data. Like theories, test statistics open critical analysis, critical commentary papers economics prestigious journals American Economic Review declined precipitously 40 years. This attributed journals' incentives maximize citations order rank higher Social Science Citation Index (SSCI).In applied economics, input-output models employing linear programming methods common. Large amounts data computer programs analyse impact policies; IMPLAN well-known example.Experimental economics promoted scientifically controlled experiments. This reduced long-noted distinction economics natural sciences allowed direct tests axioms. In cases axioms entirely correct; example, ultimatum game revealed people reject unequal offers.In behavioural economics, psychologist Daniel Kahneman Nobel Prize economics 2002 Amos Tversky's empirical discovery cognitive biases heuristics. Similar empirical testing occurs neuroeconomics. Another example assumption narrowly selfish preferences versus model tests selfish, altruistic, cooperative preferences. These techniques led argue economics "genuine science." Profession The professionalization economics, reflected growth graduate programmes subject, described "the change economics 1900". Most major universities colleges major, school, department academic degrees awarded subject, liberal arts, business, professional study.In private sector, professional economists employed consultants industry, including banking finance. Economists work government departments agencies, example, national Treasury, Central Bank Bureau Statistics.The Nobel Memorial Prize Economic Sciences (commonly Nobel Prize Economics) prize awarded economists year outstanding intellectual contributions field. Related subjects Economics social science fields bordering areas, including economic geography, economic history, public choice, energy economics, cultural economics, family economics institutional economics.Law economics, economic analysis law, approach legal theory applies methods economics law.

Georgescu-Roegen reintroduced concept entropy relation economics energy thermodynamics, distinguished viewed mechanistic foundation neoclassical economics drawn Newtonian physics. His work contributed thermoeconomics ecological economics. He foundational work developed evolutionary economics.The sociological subfield economic sociology arose, work Émile Durkheim, Max Weber Georg Simmel, approach analysing effects economic phenomena relation overarching social paradigm (i.e. modernity). Classic works include Max Weber's The Protestant Ethic Spirit Capitalism (1905) Georg Simmel's The Philosophy Money (1900). More recently, works Mark Granovetter, Peter Hedstrom Richard Swedberg influential field. History Economic writings earlier Mesopotamian, Greek, Roman, Indian subcontinent, Chinese, Persian, Arab civilizations. Notable writers Antiquity Renaissance include Aristotle, Xenophon, Chanakya (also Kautilya), Qin Shi Huang, Thomas Aquinas, Ibn Khaldun. Joseph Schumpeter described Aquinas "coming nearer group 'founders' scientific economics" monetary, interest, theory natural-law perspective.Two groups, called "mercantilists" "physiocrats", directly influenced subsequent development subject. Both groups associated economic nationalism modern capitalism Europe. Mercantilism economic doctrine flourished 16th 18th century prolific pamphlet literature, merchants statesmen. It held nation's wealth depended accumulation gold silver. Nations access mines gold silver trade selling goods abroad restricting imports gold silver. The doctrine called importing cheap raw materials manufacturing goods, exported, regulation impose protective tariffs foreign manufactured goods prohibit manufacturing colonies.Physiocrats, group 18th-century French thinkers writers, developed idea economy circular flow income output. Physiocrats believed agricultural production generated clear surplus cost, agriculture basis wealth. Thus, opposed mercantilist policy promoting manufacturing trade expense agriculture, including tariffs. Physiocrats advocated replacing administratively costly tax collections single tax income land owners. In reaction copious mercantilist trade regulations, physiocrats advocated policy laissez-faire, called minimal government intervention economy.Adam Smith (1723–1790) economic theorist. Smith harshly critical mercantilists described physiocratic system "with imperfections" "perhaps purest approximation truth published" subject. Classical political economy The publication Adam Smith's The Wealth Nations 1776, described "the effective birth economics separate discipline." The book identified land, labour, capital three factors production major contributors nation's wealth, distinct Physiocratic idea agriculture productive.Smith discusses benefits specialization division labour, including increased labour productivity trade, town country countries. His "theorem" "the division labor limited extent market" described "core theory functions firm industry" "fundamental principle economic organization." To Smith ascribed "the substantive proposition economics" foundation resource-allocation theory – that, competition, resource owners (of labour, land, capital) seek profitable uses, equal rate return equilibrium (adjusted differences arising factors training unemployment).In argument includes "one famous passages economics," Smith represents individual employ capital command advantage, society, sake profit, level employing capital domestic industry, positively produce. In this:He generally, indeed, intends promote public interest, promoting it. By preferring support domestic foreign industry, intends security; directing industry manner produce greatest value, intends gain, this, cases, led invisible promote intention. Nor worse society it. By pursuing interest frequently promotes society effectually intends promote it.The Rev. Thomas Robert Malthus (1798) concept diminishing returns explain living standards. Human population, argued, tended increase geometrically, outstripping production food, increased arithmetically. The force rapidly growing population limited amount land diminishing returns labour. The result, claimed, chronically wages, prevented standard living population rising subsistence level. Economist Julian Lincoln Simon criticized Malthus's conclusions.While Adam Smith emphasized production income, David Ricardo (1817) focused distribution income landowners, workers, capitalists. Ricardo inherent conflict landowners labour capital other. He posited growth population capital, pressing fixed supply land, pushes rents holds wages profits. Ricardo prove principle comparative advantage, country specialize producing exporting goods lower cost production, relying production. It termed "fundamental analytical explanation" trade.Coming Classical tradition, John Stuart Mill (1848) parted company earlier classical economists inevitability distribution income produced market system. Mill pointed distinct difference market's roles: allocation resources distribution income. The market efficient allocating resources distributing income, wrote, making society intervene.Value theory classical theory. Smith wrote "real price ... toil trouble acquiring it" influenced scarcity. Smith maintained that, profit, costs wages enter price commodity. Other classical economists presented variations Smith, termed 'labour theory value'. Classical economics focused tendency market economy settle final stationary constant stock physical wealth (capital) constant population size. Marxism Marxist (later, Marxian) economics descends classical economics. It derives work Karl Marx. The volume Marx's major work, Das Kapital, published German 1867. In it, Marx focused labour theory theory surplus which, believed, explained exploitation labour capital. The labour theory held exchanged commodity determined labour production theory surplus demonstrated workers paid proportion work created. Neoclassical economics At dawn social science, economics defined discussed length study production, distribution, consumption wealth Jean-Baptiste Say "Treatise Political Economy or, The Production, Distribution, Consumption Wealth" (1803). These three items considered science relation increase diminution wealth, reference processes execution. Say's definition prevailed time, saved substituting "wealth" "goods services" meaning wealth include material objects well. One thirty years later, Lionel Robbins noticed definition longer sufficed, economists making theoretical philosophical inroads areas human activity. In Essay Nature Significance Economic Science, proposed definition economics study aspect human behaviour, falls influence scarcity, forces people choose, allocate scarce resources competing ends, economize (seeking greatest welfare avoiding wasting scarce resources). For Robbins, insufficiency solved, definition allows proclaim, easy conscience, education economics, safety security economics, health economics, economics, course, production, distribution consumption economics valid subjects economic science.Citing Robbins: "Economics science studies human behavior relationship scarce alternative uses". After discussing decades, Robbins' definition accepted mainstream economists, opened current textbooks. Although unanimous, mainstream economists accept version Robbins' definition, raised serious objections scope method economics, emanating definition. Due lack consensus, production, distribution consumption goods services prime area study economics, definition stands quarters.A theory termed "neoclassical economics" "marginalism" formed 1870 1910. The term "economics" popularized neoclassical economists Alfred Marshall concise synonym 'economic science' substitute earlier "political economy". This corresponded influence subject mathematical methods natural sciences.Neoclassical economics systematized supply demand joint determinants price quantity market equilibrium, allocation output distribution income. It dispensed labour theory inherited classical economics favour marginal utility theory demand general theory costs supply side. In 20th century, neoclassical theorists moved earlier notion suggesting total utility society measured favour ordinal utility, hypothesizes behaviour-based relations persons.In microeconomics, neoclassical economics represents incentives costs playing pervasive role shaping decision making. An example consumer theory individual demand, isolates prices (as costs) income quantity demanded. In macroeconomics reflected lasting neoclassical synthesis Keynesian macroeconomics.Neoclassical economics occasionally referred orthodox economics critics sympathizers. Modern mainstream economics builds neoclassical economics refinements supplement generalize earlier analysis, econometrics, game theory, analysis market failure imperfect competition, neoclassical model economic growth analysing long-run variables national income.Neoclassical economics studies behaviour individuals, households, organizations (called economic actors, players, agents), manage scarce resources, alternative uses, achieve desired ends. Agents assumed rationally, multiple desirable sight, limited resources ends, set stable preferences, definite guiding objective, capability making choice. There exists economic problem, subject study economic science, decision (choice) resource-controlling players attain best outcome bounded rational conditions. In words, resource-controlling agents maximize subject constraints imposed agents have, cognitive limitations, finite amount execute decision. Economic science centres activities economic agents comprise society. They focus economic analysis.An approach understanding processes, study agent behaviour scarcity, follows:The continuous interplay (exchange trade) economic actors markets sets prices goods services which, turn, rational managing scarce resources possible. At time, decisions (choices) actors, pursuing interest, determine level output (production), consumption, savings, investment, economy, well remuneration (distribution) paid owners labour (in wages), capital (in profits) land (in rent). Each period, giant feedback system, economic players influence pricing processes economy, turn influenced steady (equilibrium) variables involved reached external shock throws system equilibrium point. Because autonomous actions rational interacting agents, economy complex adaptive system. Keynesian economics Keynesian economics derives John Maynard Keynes, book The General Theory Employment, Interest Money (1936), ushered contemporary macroeconomics distinct field. The book focused determinants national income short prices inflexible. Keynes attempted explain broad theoretical detail high labour-market unemployment self-correcting "effective demand" price flexibility monetary policy unavailing. The term "revolutionary" applied book impact economic analysis.Keynesian economics successors. Post-Keynesian economics concentrates macroeconomic rigidities adjustment processes. Research micro foundations models represented based real-life practices simple optimizing models. It generally associated University Cambridge work Joan Robinson.New-Keynesian economics associated developments Keynesian fashion. Within group researchers share economists emphasis models employing micro foundations optimizing behaviour narrower focus standard Keynesian themes price wage rigidity. These endogenous features models, simply assumed older Keynesian-style ones. Chicago school economics The Chicago School economics best free market advocacy monetarist ideas. According Milton Friedman monetarists, market economies inherently stable money supply greatly expand contract. Ben Bernanke, Chairman Federal Reserve, economists today generally accepting Friedman's analysis Great Depression.Milton Friedman effectively basic principles set Adam Smith classical economists modernized them. One example article September 1970 issue The New York Times Magazine, claims social responsibility business "to resources engage activities designed increase profits ... (through) open free competition deception fraud." Other schools approaches Other well-known schools trends thought referring style economics practised disseminated well-defined groups academicians worldwide, include Austrian School, Freiburg School, School Lausanne, post-Keynesian economics Stockholm school. Contemporary mainstream economics separated Saltwater approach universities Eastern Western coasts US, Freshwater, Chicago-school approach.Within macroeconomics is, general order appearance literature; classical economics, Keynesian economics, neoclassical synthesis, post-Keynesian economics, monetarism, classical economics, supply-side economics. Alternative developments include ecological economics, constitutional economics, institutional economics, evolutionary economics, dependency theory, structuralist economics, systems theory, econophysics, feminist economics biophysical economics. Agreements According random anonymous surveys members American Economic Association, economists agreement propositions percentage:A ceiling rents reduces quantity quality housing available. (93% agree)Tariffs quotas reduce general economic welfare. (93% agree)Flexible floating exchange rates offer effective international monetary arrangement. (90% agree)Fiscal policy (e.g., tax cut and/or government expenditure increase) stimulative impact employed economy. (90% agree)The United States restrict employers outsourcing work foreign countries. (90% agree)Economic growth developed countries United States leads greater levels well-being. (88% agree)The United States eliminate agricultural subsidies. (85% agree)An appropriately designed fiscal policy increase long-run rate capital formation. (85% agree)Local governments eliminate subsidies professional sports franchises. (85% agree)If federal budget balanced, business cycle yearly.

(79% agree)The government restructure welfare system lines “negative income tax.” (79% agree)Effluent taxes marketable pollution permits represent better approach pollution control imposition pollution ceilings. (78% agree)Government subsidies ethanol United States reduced eliminated. (78% agree) Criticisms General criticisms "The dismal science" derogatory alternative economics devised Victorian historian Thomas Carlyle 19th century. It stated Carlyle economics nickname "the dismal science" response 18th century writings The Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus, grimly predicted starvation result, projected population growth exceeded rate increase food supply. However, phrase coined Carlyle context debate John Stuart Mill slavery, Carlyle argued slavery, Mill opposed it.Some economists, John Stuart Mill Léon Walras, maintained production wealth tied distribution.In The Wealth Nations, Adam Smith addressed issues currently subject debate dispute. Smith repeatedly attacks groups politically aligned individuals attempt collective influence manipulate government bidding. In Smith's day, referred factions, commonly called interests, term comprise international bankers, corporate conglomerations, outright oligopolies, monopolies, trade unions groups.Economics se, social science, independent political acts government decision-making organization, however, policymakers individuals holding highly ranked positions influence people's lives arbitrarily plethora economic concepts rhetoric vehicles legitimize agendas systems, limit remarks matters relevant responsibilities. The close relation economic theory practice politics focus contention shade distort unpretentious original tenets economics, confused social agendas systems.Notwithstanding, economics legitimately role informing government policy. It is, indeed, outgrowth older field political economy. Some academic economic journals currently focusing increased efforts gauging consensus economists policy issues hopes effecting informed political environment. Currently, exists approval rate professional economists public policies. Policy issues featured survey American Economic Association economists include trade restrictions, social insurance work international competition, genetically modified foods, curbside recycling, health insurance (several questions), medical malpractice, barriers entering medical profession, organ donations, unhealthy foods, mortgage deductions, taxing internet sales, Wal-Mart, casinos, ethanol subsidies, inflation targeting.In Steady State Economics 1977, leading ecological economist steady-state theorist Herman Daly argues exist logical inconsistencies emphasis economic growth limited availability natural resources.Issues central bank independence, central bank policies rhetoric central bank governors discourse premises macroeconomic policies (monetary fiscal policy) state, focus contention criticism.Deirdre McCloskey argued empirical economic studies reported, Stephen Ziliak argue critique well-received, practice improved. This contention controversial.A 2002 International Monetary Fund study looked "consensus forecasts" (the forecasts groups economists) advance 60 national recessions 1990s: 97% cases economists predict contraction year advance. On rare occasions economists predict recessions, underestimated severity. Criticisms assumptions Economics subject criticism relies unrealistic, unverifiable, highly simplified assumptions, cases assumptions simplify proofs desired conclusions. Examples assumptions include perfect information, profit maximization rational choices. The field economics includes mathematical-economical behavioural economics, studies behavioural psychology.Nevertheless, prominent mainstream economists Keynes Joskow observed economics conceptual quantitative, difficult model formalize quantitatively. In discussion oligopoly research, Paul Joskow pointed 1975 practice, serious students economies tended "informal models" based qualitative factors industries. Joskow feeling work oligopoly informal observations formal models "trotted post". He argued formal models empirical work, either, fundamental factor theory firm, behaviour, neglected.In years, feminist critiques neoclassical economic models gained prominence, leading feminist economics. Contrary common conceptions economics positive objective science, feminist economists attention social construction economics highlight models methods reflect masculine preferences. Primary criticisms focus failures account for: selfish nature actors (homo economicus); exogenous tastes; impossibility utility comparisons; exclusion unpaid work; exclusion class gender considerations. Feminist economics developed address concerns, field includes critical examinations areas economics including paid unpaid work, economic epistemology history, globalization, household economics care economy. In 1988, Marilyn Waring published book If Women Counted, argues discipline economics ignores women's unpaid work nature; Julie A. Nelson, If Women Counted "showed exactly unpaid work traditionally women invisible national accounting systems" "issued wake-up issues ecological sustainability." Bjørnholt McKay argue financial crisis 2007–08 response revealed crisis ideas mainstream economics economics profession, reshaping economy, economic theory economics profession. They argue reshaping include advances feminist economics starting point socially responsible, sensible accountable subject creating economy economic theories acknowledge care well planet.Philip Mirowski observes thatThe imperatives orthodox programme [of economic science] leave room maneuver room originality. ... These mandates ... Appropriate mathematical techniques metaphorical expressions contemporary respectable science, physics possible. ... Preserve maximum extent attendant nineteenth-century overtones "natural order" ... Deny strenuously neoclassical theory slavishly imitates physics. ... Above all, prevent rival programmes encroaching ... ridiculing external attempts appropriate twentieth century physics models. ... All theorizing [in way] held hostage nineteenth-century concepts energy.In series peer-reviewed journal conference papers books published period decades, John McMurtry provided extensive criticism terms "unexamined assumptions implications [of economics], consequent cost people's lives."Nassim Nicholas Taleb Michael Perelman additional scholars criticized conventional mainstream economics. Taleb opposes economic theorizing, view suffers acutely problem overuse Plato's Theory Forms, calls cancellation Nobel Memorial Prize Economics, damage economic theories devastating. Michael Perelman extensive criticism economics assumptions books (and books published 2000 date), papers interviews.Despite concerns, mainstream graduate programs increasingly technical mathematical.

Marketing study management exchange relationships. The American Marketing Association defined marketing "the activity, set institutions, processes creating, communicating, delivering, exchanging offerings customers, clients, partners, society large." Marketing create customer, customer satisfy customer. With customer focus activities, concluded Marketing premier components Business Management Innovation. Other services management activities Operations (or Production), Human Resources, Accounting, Law Legal aspects "bought in" "contracted out". Definition Marketing defined American Marketing Association "the activity, set institutions, processes creating, communicating, delivering, exchanging offerings customers, clients, partners, society large." The term developed original meaning referred literally going market buy sell goods services. Seen systems point view, sales process engineering views marketing "a set processes interconnected interdependent functions, methods improved variety approaches."The Chartered Institute Marketing defines marketing "the management process responsible identifying, anticipating satisfying customer requirements profitably." A concept value-based marketing role marketing contribute increasing shareholder value. In context, marketing defined "the management process seeks maximise returns shareholders developing relationships valued customers creating competitive advantage."Marketing practice tended creative industry past, included advertising, distribution selling. However, academic study marketing extensive social sciences, psychology, sociology, mathematics, economics, anthropology neuroscience, profession recognized science, allowing numerous universities offer Master-of-Science (MSc) programmes. The process starts marketing market segmentation, business planning execution, post-sales promotional activities. It creative arts. The marketing literature adept re-inventing vocabulary culture. The marketing concept The term marketing concept pertains fundamental premise modern marketing. This concept proposes order satisfy organizational objectives, organization anticipate consumers satisfy effectively competitors. Marketing marketing concepts directly related. Marketing orientations An orientation, marketing context, relates perception attitude firm holds product service, essentially concerning consumers end-users. There exist common orientations: Product orientation A firm employing product orientation chiefly concerned quality product. A firm assume product high standard, people buy consume product.This works effectively firm good insights customers desires, example case Sony Walkman Apple iPod, derive intuitions research. Sales orientation A firm sales orientation focuses selling/promotion product, determining consumer desires such. Consequently, entails simply selling existing product, promotion techniques attain highest sales possible.Such orientation suit scenarios firm holds dead stock, sells product high demand, likelihood changes consumer tastes diminishing demand. Production orientation A firm focusing production orientation specializes producing product service. Thus, signifies firm exploiting economies scale, minimum efficient scale reached.A production orientation deployed high demand product service exists, coupled good certainty consumer tastes rapidly alter (similar sales orientation). Marketing orientation The marketing orientation common orientation contemporary marketing. It involves firm essentially basing marketing plans marketing concept, supplying products suit consumer tastes.As example, firm employ market gauge consumer desires, R&D develop product attuned revealed information, utilize promotion techniques ensure persons product exists. The marketing orientation three prime facets, are: Customer orientation A firm market economy survive producing goods persons buy. Consequently, ascertaining consumer demand vital firm's future viability existence going concern. Organizational orientation In sense, firm's marketing department prime functional level organization.Information organization's marketing department guide actions department's firm. As example, marketing department ascertain (via marketing research) consumers desired type product, usage existing product. With mind, marketing department R&D department create prototype product/service based consumers' desires.The production department start manufacture product, marketing department focus promotion, distribution, pricing, etc. product. Additionally, firm's finance department consulted, securing appropriate funding development, production promotion product.Inter-departmental conflicts occur, firm adhere marketing orientation. Production oppose installation, support servicing capital stock, needed manufacture product. Finance oppose required capital expenditure, undermine healthy cash flow organization. Mutually beneficial exchange In transaction market economy, firm revenue, leads profits/market share/sales. A consumer satisfaction need/want, utility, reliability money purchase product service. As buy goods supplier market economy, firms entice consumers buy goods contemporary marketing ideals. The Four Ps In 1960s, Professor Neil Borden Harvard Business School identified number company performance actions influence consumer decision purchase goods services. Borden suggested actions company represented “Marketing Mix”. Professor E. Jerome McCarthy, Michigan State University 1960s, suggested Marketing Mix contained 4 elements: product, price, promotion.ProductThe product aspects marketing deal specifications goods services, relates end-user's wants. The scope product generally includes supporting elements warranties, guarantees, support.PricingThis refers process setting price product, including discounts. The price monetary; simply exchanged product services, e.g. time, energy, attention. Methods setting prices optimally domain pricing science.Placement (or distribution)This refers product customer; example, point-of-sale placement retailing. This third P called Place, referring channel product service sold (e.g. online vs. retail), geographic region industry, segment (young adults, families, business people), etc. referring environment product sold sales.PromotionThis includes advertising, sales promotion, including promotional education, publicity, personal selling. Branding refers methods promoting product, brand, company.These elements referred marketing mix, marketer craft marketing plan.The Ps model marketing consumer products. Industrial products, services, high consumer products require adjustments model. Services marketing account unique nature services.Industrial B2B marketing account term contractual agreements typical supply chain transactions. Relationship marketing attempts marketing term relationship perspective individual transactions.As counter this, Morgan, Riding Waves Change (Jossey-Bass, 1988), suggests greatest limitations 4 Ps approach "is unconsciously emphasizes inside–out view (looking company outwards), essence marketing outside–in approach".In order recognize aspects selling services, opposed Products, three Ps range Seven Ps service industries:Process orders handled, customers satisfied service delivered.Physical Evidence tangible evidence service customers receive (for example holiday brochure).People people meeting dealing customers.As markets satisfied, 7 Ps relevant companies selling products, well solely involved services: customers differentiate sellers goods service receive process people involved.Some authors cite P Packaging thought Product, markets (Japan, China example) products (perfume, cosmetics) packaging product greater product itself. The marketing environment The term "marketing environment" relates factors (whether internal, external, direct indirect) firm's marketing decision-making/planning. A firm's marketing environment consists three areas, are:The macro-environment, firm holds controlThe micro-environment, firm holds greater amount (though total) control The macro-environment A firm's marketing macro-environment consists variety external factors manifest (or macro) scale. These typically economic, social, political technological phenomena. A common method assessing firm's macro-environment PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Ecological) analysis. Within PESTLE analysis, firm analyze national political issues, culture climate, macroeconomic conditions, health indicators (such economic growth, inflation, unemployment, etc.), social trends/attitudes, nature technology's impact society business processes society. The micro-environment A firm's micro-environment comprises factors pertinent firm itself, stakeholders closely connected firm company.A firm's micro-environment typically spans:Customers/consumersEmployeesSuppliersThe MediaBy contrast macro-environment, organization holds greater degree control factors. Marketing Marketing involves conducting support marketing activities, statistical interpretation data information. This managers plan marketing activities, gauge nature firm's marketing environment, attain suppliers, etc.A distinction marketing market research. Market pertains market. As example, firm conduct target market, selecting suitable market segment. In contrast, marketing relates conducted marketing. Thus, market subset marketing research.Marketing researchers statistical methods (such quantitative research, qualitative research, hypothesis tests, Chi-square tests, linear regression, correlation coefficients, frequency distributions, Poisson binomial distributions, etc.) interpret findings convert data information. The Marketing Research Process Marketing spans number stages, including:Define problemDevelop planCollect dataInterpret data informationDisseminate formally report Market segmentation Market segmentation consists total heterogeneous market product dividing sub-markets segments, homogeneous aspects. The purposes market segmentation Market segmentation conducted purposes, including:- A better allocation firm's finite resources- To better serve diversified tastes contemporary Western consumersA firm possesses amount resources. Accordingly, choices (and appreciate costs) servicing groups consumers.Moreover, diversity tastes modern consumers, firms noting benefit servicing multiplicity markets. Overview segmentation process Segmentation defined terms STP acronym, meaning Segment, Target, Position. Segment Segmentation involves initial splitting consumers persons needs/wants/tastes.Four commonly criteria segmentation, include:Geographical (a country, region, city, town, etc.)Psychographic (i.e. personality traits character traits influence consumer behaviour)Demographic (e.g. age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.)Behavioural (e.g. brand loyalty, usage rate, etc.) Target Once segment identified, firm ascertain segment beneficial service.The DAMP acronym (meaning Discernable, Accessible, Measurable Profitable) criteria gauge viability target market. DAMP explained detail below:- Discernable segment differentiated segments.- Accessible segment accessed Marketing Communications produced firm- Measurable segment quantified size determined?- Profitable return investment attained segment's servicing?The step targeting process level differentiation involved segment serving. Three modes differentiation exist, commonly applied firms. These are:Undifferentiated company produces product market segmentDifferentiated firm produced modifications product segmentNiche organisation forges product satisfy specialised target market Position Positioning concerns position product minds consumers.A firm performs producing perceptual map, denotes products produced industry consumers perceive price quality. From product's placing map, firm tailor marketing communications suit meld product's perception consumers. Marketing communications Marketing communications defined actions firm takes communicate end-users, consumers external parties. Marketing communications encompasses distinct subsets, are: Personal sales Oral presentation salesperson approaches individuals group customers:Live, interactive relationshipPersonal interestAttention responseInteresting presentationClear thorough. Sales promotion Short-term incentives encourage buying products:Instant appealAnxiety sellAn example coupons sale. People incentive buy, build customer loyalty encourage future repeat buys. A major drawback sales promotion easily copied competition. It sustainable source differentiation. Public Relations Public Relations (or PR, acronym) tools firm order promote goodwill organization target market segment, consumers firm's good/service. PR stems fact firm seek antagonize inflame market base, incurring lessened demand good/service. Organizations undertake PR order assure consumers, forestall negative perceptions it.PR span:InterviewsSpeeches/PresentationsCorporate literature, financial statements, brochures, etc. Publicity Publicity involves attaining space media, pay directly coverage. As example, organization launch product covered newspaper TV news segment. This benefits firm question making consumers aware product, paying newspaper television station cover event. Advertising Advertising occurs firm directly pays channel publicize product. Common examples include TV radio adverts, billboards, branding, sponsorship, etc. Marketing communications "mix" Marketing communications "sub-mix" Promotion aspect marketing mix, exact nature apply marketing communications depends nature product question.Accordingly, product require unique communications mix, order convey consumers. Some products require stronger emphasis personal sales, focus advertising. Marketing Planning The area marketing planning involves forging plan firm's marketing activities. A marketing plan pertain product, well organisation's marketing strategy.Generally speaking, organisation's marketing planning process derived business strategy. Thus, management devising firm's strategic direction/mission, intended marketing activities incorporated plan. Marketing Planning Process Within strategic marketing plan, stages process listed thus:Mission StatementCorporate ObjectivesMarketing AuditSWOT analysisAssumptions arising Audit SWOT analysisMarketing objectives derived assumptionsAn estimation expected objectivesIdentification alternative plans/mixesBudgeting marketing planA first-year implementation program Levels marketing objectives organization As stated previously, senior management firm formulate general business strategy firm. However, general business strategy interpreted implemented contexts firm. Corporate Corporate marketing objectives typically broad-based nature, pertain general vision firm short, medium long-term.As example, pictures group companies (or conglomerate), management sales group increase 25% year period. Strategic business unit Strategic business unit (SBU), case, strategic business unit. An SBU subsidiary firm, participates market/industry. The SBU embrace corporate strategy, attune industry. For instance, SBU partake sports goods industry. It ascertain attain additional sales sports goods, order satisfy business strategy. Functional The functional level relates departments SBUs, marketing, finance, HR, production, etc. The functional level SBU's strategy determine accomplish SBU's objectives market.To example sports goods industry again, marketing department draw marketing plans, strategies communications help SBU achieve marketing aims. Product Life Cycle The Product Life Cycle (or PLC, short) tool marketing managers gauge progress product, relating sales/revenue accrued time. The PLC based assumptions, including:- A product possess Introduction, Growth, Maturity Decline stage. No product lasts perpetually market. A firm employ differing strategies, product PLC. Introduction In stage, product launched market. To stimulate growth sales/revenue, advertising high, order heighten awareness product question. Growth The product's sales/revenue increasing, stimulate marketing communications sustain sales. More entrants enter market, reap high profits industry producing. Maturity A product's sales start level off, increasing number entrants market produce price falls product. Firms utilise sales promotions raise sales. Decline Demand good taper off, firm discontinue manufacture product. This so, revenue product efficiency savings production, sales good/service. However, product services niche market, complementary product, continue manufacture product, despite level sales/revenue accrued. Customer focus Many companies today customer focus (or market orientation). This implies company focuses activities products consumer demands. Generally three this: customer-driven approach, sense identifying market changes product innovation approach.In consumer-driven approach, consumer drivers strategic marketing decisions. No strategy pursued passes test consumer research. Every aspect market offering, including nature product itself, driven consumers. The starting point consumer. The rationale approach point spending R&D funds developing products people buy. History attests products commercial failures spite technological breakthroughs.A formal approach customer-focused marketing SIVA (Solution, Information, Value, Access). This system basically Ps renamed reworded customer focus.The SIVA Model demand/customer centric version alternative well-known 4Ps supply model (product, price, place, promotion) marketing management. Product focus In product innovation approach, company pursues product innovation, develop market product. Product innovation drives process marketing conducted ensure profitable market segment(s) exist innovation. The rationale customers options future expect buy future. However, marketers aggressively over-pursue product innovation overcapitalize niche. When pursuing product innovation approach, marketers ensure varied multi-tiered approach product innovation. It claimed Thomas Edison depended marketing produced larger candles inventing bulbs. Many firms, development focused companies, focus product innovation. Many purists doubt marketing orientation all, post status consumer research. Some question marketing.An emerging area study practice concerns internal marketing, employees trained managed deliver brand positively impacts acquisition retention customers (employer branding).Diffusion innovations explores people products, services ideas.A marketing Internet called Internet marketing generally e-marketing, affiliate marketing, desktop advertising online marketing. It perfect segmentation strategy traditional marketing. It targets audience precisely, called personalized marketing one-to-one marketing.With consumers' eroding attention span willingness advertising messages, marketers turning forms permission marketing branded content, custom reality marketing.The herd behavior marketing.The Economist reported conference Rome subject simulation adaptive human behavior. It shared mechanisms increase impulse buying people "to buy playing herd instinct." The basic idea people buy products popular, feedback mechanisms product popularity consumers mentioned, including smart-cart technology Radio Frequency Identification Tag technology. A "swarm-moves" model introduced Florida Institute Technology researcher, appealing supermarkets "increase sales people discounts."Marketing promote business' products great promote business.Other studies "power social influence" include "artificial music market 14,000 people downloaded unknown songs" (Columbia University, New York); Japanese chain convenience stores orders products based "sales data department stores companies;" Massachusetts company exploiting knowledge social networking improve sales; online retailers increasingly informing consumers "which products popular like-minded consumers" (e.g., Amazon, eBay).

An airplane aeroplane (informally plane) powered, fixed-wing aircraft propelled forward thrust jet engine propeller. Airplanes variety sizes, shapes, configurations. The broad spectrum airplanes includes recreation, transportation goods people, military, research. Commercial aviation massive industry involving flying tens thousands passengers daily airliners. Most airplanes flown pilot board aircraft, designed remotely computer-controlled.The Wright brothers invented flew airplane 1903, recognized "the sustained controlled heavier-than-air powered flight". They built works George Cayley dating 1799, set concept modern airplane (and built flew models passenger-carrying gliders). Between 1867 1896, German pioneer human aviation Otto Lilienthal studied heavier-than-air flight. Following limited World War I, aircraft technology continued develop. Airplanes presence major battles World War II. The jet aircraft German Heinkel He 178 1939. The jet airliner, Havilland Comet, introduced 1952. The Boeing 707, commercial jet, commercial service 50 years, 1958 2013. Etymology usage First attested English 19th century (prior sustained powered flight), airplane, aeroplane, derives French aéroplane, Greek ἀήρ (aēr), "air" Latin planus, "level", Greek πλάνος (planos), "wandering". "Aéroplane" originally referred wing, plane moving air. In example synecdoche, refer entire aircraft.In United States Canada, term "airplane" powered fixed-wing aircraft. In United Kingdom Commonwealth, term "aeroplane" (pronounced /ˈɛərəpleɪn/) applied aircraft. History Antecedents Many stories antiquity involve flight, Greek legend Icarus Daedalus, Vimana ancient Indian epics. Around 400 BC Greece, Archytas reputed designed built artificial, self-propelled flying device, bird-shaped model propelled jet steam, flown 200 (660 ft). This machine suspended flight.Some earliest recorded attempts gliders 9th-century poet Abbas ibn Firnas 11th-century monk Eilmer Malmesbury; experiments injured pilots. Leonardo Vinci researched design birds designed man-powered aircraft Codex Flight Birds (1502).In 1799, George Cayley set concept modern airplane fixed-wing flying machine separate systems lift, propulsion, control. Cayley building flying models fixed-wing aircraft 1803, built passenger-carrying glider 1853. In 1856, Frenchman Jean-Marie Le Bris powered flight, glider "L'Albatros artificiel" pulled horse beach. Then Alexander F. Mozhaisky innovative designs. In 1883, American John J. Montgomery controlled flight glider. Other aviators flights Otto Lilienthal, Percy Pilcher, Octave Chanute.Sir Hiram Maxim built craft weighed 3.5 tons, 110-foot (34 meter) wingspan powered 360-horsepower (270 kW) steam engines driving propellers. In 1894, machine tested overhead rails prevent rising. The test lift off. The craft uncontrollable, Maxim, presumed, realized, subsequently abandoned work it.In 1890s, Lawrence Hargrave conducted structures developed box kite lifted weight man. His box kite designs adopted. Although developed type rotary aircraft engine, create powered fixed-wing aircraft.Between 1867 1896 German pioneer human aviation Otto Lilienthal developed heavier-than-air flight. He person well-documented, repeated, gliding flights. Early powered flights The Wright brothers flights 1903 recognized Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), standard setting record-keeping aeronautics, "the sustained controlled heavier-than-air powered flight". By 1905, Wright Flyer III capable controllable, stable flight periods. The Wright brothers credited Otto Lilienthal major inspiration decision pursue manned flight.In 1906, Alberto Santos-Dumont claimed airplane flight unassisted catapult set record recognized Aéro-Club France flying 220 meters (720 ft) 22 seconds. This flight certified FAI.An aircraft design brought modern monoplane tractor configuration Blériot VIII design 1908. It movable tail surfaces controlling yaw pitch, roll control supplied warping ailerons controlled pilot joystick rudder bar. It predecessor Blériot XI Channel-crossing aircraft summer 1909.In Romania aircraft, A. Vlaicu nr. 1, finished 1909, test flown June 17, 1910. From flight airplane changes. The plane single aluminum spar 10 (33 ft) supported entire aircraft, making easy fly. Ten planes Romanian Air Force, second-ever military air force world.World War I served testbed airplane weapon. Airplanes demonstrated mobile observation platforms, proved machines capable causing casualties enemy. The earliest aerial victory synchronized machine gun-armed fighter aircraft occurred 1915, German Luftstreitkräfte Leutnant Kurt Wintgens. Fighter aces appeared; greatest (by number Aerial Combat victories) Manfred von Richthofen.Following WWI, aircraft technology continued develop. Alcock Brown crossed Atlantic non-stop 1919. The international commercial flights United States Canada 1919.Airplanes presence major battles World War II. They essential component military strategies period, German Blitzkrieg, The Battle Britain, American Japanese aircraft carrier campaigns Pacific War. Development jet aircraft The 'operational' jet aircraft German Heinkel He 178, tested 1939. In 1943, Messerschmitt Me 262, 'operational' jet fighter aircraft, service German Luftwaffe. In October 1947, Bell X-1 aircraft exceed speed sound.The jet airliner, Havilland Comet, introduced 1952. The Boeing 707, commercial jet, commercial service 50 years, 1958 2010. The Boeing 747 world's biggest passenger aircraft 1970 surpassed Airbus A380 2005. Propulsion Propeller engines Smaller older propeller planes reciprocating engines (or piston engines) turn propeller create thrust. The amount thrust propeller creates determined disk area area blades rotate. If area small, efficiency poor, area large, propeller rotate speed avoid going supersonic creating lot noise, thrust. Because limitation, propellers favored planes travel mach .5, jets better choice speed. Propeller engines quieter jet engines (though always) cost purchase maintain remain common general aviation aircraft Cessna 172. Larger modern propeller planes Dash 8 jet engine turn propeller, equivalent piston engine power output larger complex. Jet engines Jet aircraft propelled jet engines, aerodynamic limitations propellers apply jet propulsion. These engines powerful reciprocating engine size weight comparatively quiet work well higher altitude. Most modern jet planes turbofan jet engines balance advantages propeller, retaining exhaust speed power jet. This essentially ducted propeller attached jet engine, turboprop, smaller diameter. When installed airliner, efficient remains speed sound (or subsonic). Jet fighters supersonic aircraft spend great deal supersonic turbofans, function, air intake ducting needed slow air arrives front turbofan, subsonic. When passing engine, re-accelerated supersonic speeds. To boost power output, fuel dumped exhaust stream, ignites. This called afterburner pure jet aircraft turbojet aircraft combat aircraft amount fuel consumed, short periods time. Supersonic airliners (e.g. Concorde) longer flight supersonic speed creates sonic boom prohibited heavily populated areas, higher consumption fuel supersonic flight requires.Jet aircraft possess high cruising speeds (700 900 km/h (430 560 mph)) high speeds takeoff landing (150 250 km/h (93 155 mph)). Due speed needed takeoff landing, jet aircraft flaps leading edge devices control lift speed. Many jet aircraft thrust reversers slow aircraft landing. Electric engines An electric aircraft runs electric motors internal combustion engines, electricity fuel cells, solar cells, ultracapacitors, power beaming, batteries. Currently, flying electric aircraft experimental prototypes, including manned unmanned aerial vehicles, production models market already. Rocket engines In World War II, Germans deployed Me 163 Komet rocket-powered aircraft. The plane break sound barrier level flight rocket plane – Bell X-1. The North American X-15 broke speed altitude records laid groundwork aircraft spacecraft design. Rocket aircraft common usage today, rocket-assisted offs military aircraft. Recent rocket aircraft include SpaceShipOne XCOR EZ-Rocket.There rocket-powered aircraft/spacecraft planes, spaceplanes, designed Earth's atmosphere. Ramjet scramjet engines A ramjet jet engine major moving parts applications requiring small simple engine high-speed use, missiles. Ramjets require forward motion generate thrust conjunction forms propulsion, external achieving speed. The Lockheed D-21 Mach 3+ ramjet-powered reconnaissance drone launched aircraft. A ramjet vehicle's forward motion force air engine resorting turbines vanes. Fuel ignited, heats expands air thrust.A scramjet supersonic ramjet differences dealing internal supersonic airflow works conventional ramjet. This type engine requires high initial speed order work. The NASA X-43, experimental unmanned scramjet, set speed record 2004 jet-powered aircraft speed Mach 9.7, 7,500 miles hour (12,100 km/h). Design manufacture Most airplanes constructed companies objective producing quantity customers. The design planning process, including safety tests, years small turboprops longer larger planes.During process, objectives design specifications aircraft established. First construction company drawings equations, simulations, wind tunnel tests experience predict behavior aircraft. Computers companies draw, plan initial simulations aircraft. Small models mockups parts plane tested wind tunnels verify aerodynamics.When design passed processes, company constructs limited number prototypes testing ground. Representatives aviation governing agency flight. The flight tests continue aircraft fulfilled requirements. Then, governing public agency aviation country authorizes company production.In United States, agency Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), European Union, European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). In Canada, public agency charge authorizing mass production aircraft Transport Canada.In case international sales, license public agency aviation transport country aircraft necessary. For example, airplanes European company, Airbus, certified FAA flown United States, airplanes U.S.-based Boeing approved EASA flown European Union.Quieter planes increase air traffic, urban areas, aircraft noise pollution major concern.Small planes designed constructed amateurs homebuilts. Other homebuilt aircraft assembled pre-manufactured kits parts assembled basic plane completed builder.There companies produce planes scale. However, production plane company process involves dozens, hundreds, companies plants, produce parts plane. For example, company responsible production landing gear, responsible radar. The production parts limited city country; case plane manufacturing companies, parts world.The parts plant plane company, production located. In case planes, production lines dedicated assembly parts plane exist, wings fuselage.When complete, plane rigorously inspected imperfections defects. After approval inspectors, plane series flight tests assure systems working correctly plane handles properly. Upon passing tests, plane receive "final touchups" (internal configuration, painting, etc.), customer. Characteristics Airframe The structural parts fixed-wing aircraft called airframe. The parts vary aircraft's type purpose. Early types wood fabric surfaces, When engines powered flight years ago, mounts metal. Then speeds increased parts metal WWII all-metal aircraft common. In modern times, increasing composite materials made.Typical structural parts include:One horizontal wings, airfoil cross-section shape. The deflects air aircraft moves forward, generating lifting force support flight. The stability roll aircraft rolling left steady flight.A fuselage, long, body, tapered rounded shape aerodynamically smooth. The fuselage joins parts airframe things pilot, payload flight systems.A vertical stabilizer fin vertical wing-like surface mounted rear plane typically protruding it. The fin stabilizes plane's yaw (turn left right) mounts rudder controls rotation axis.A horizontal stabilizer tailplane, mounted tail vertical stabilizer. The horizontal stabilizer stabilize plane's pitch (tilt down) mounts elevators pitch control.Landing gear, set wheels, skids, floats support plane surface. On seaplanes bottom fuselage floats (pontoons) support water. On planes landing gear retracts flight reduce drag. Wings The wings fixed-wing aircraft static planes extending aircraft. When aircraft travels forwards, air flows wings shaped create lift. This shape called airfoil shaped bird's wing. Wing structure Airplanes flexible surfaces stretched frame rigid lift forces exerted airflow them. Larger aircraft rigid surfaces additional strength.Whether flexible rigid, wings frame shape transfer lift surface rest aircraft. The structural elements spars running root tip, ribs running leading (front) trailing (rear) edge.Early airplane engines power, lightness important. Also, airfoil sections thin, frame installed within. So 1930s wings lightweight strength external bracing struts wires added. When engine power increased 1920s 30s, wings heavy bracing needed more. This type unbraced called cantilever wing. Wing configuration The number shape wings varies types. A plane full-span divided central fuselage (left) starboard (right) wings. Occasionally wings used, three-winged triplane achieving fame WWI. The four-winged quadruplane multiplane designs success.A monoplane single plane, biplane stacked other, tandem other. When engine power increased 1920s 30s bracing longer needed, unbraced cantilever monoplane common powered type.The planform shape above. To aerodynamically efficient, straight span short chord (high aspect ratio). But structurally efficient, weight, short span area lift (low aspect ratio).At transonic speeds (near speed sound), helps sweep backwards forwards reduce drag supersonic shock waves form. The swept straight swept backwards forwards.The delta triangle shape number reasons. As flexible Rogallo allows stable shape aerodynamic forces, ultralight aircraft kites. As supersonic combines high strength drag fast jets.A variable geometry changed flight shape. The variable-sweep transforms efficient straight configuration takeoff landing, low-drag swept configuration high-speed flight. Other forms variable planform flown, stage. Fuselage A fuselage long, body, tapered rounded shape aerodynamically smooth. The fuselage flight crew, passengers, cargo payload, fuel engines. The pilots manned aircraft operate cockpit located front fuselage equipped controls windows instruments. A plane fuselage, fitted booms tail located booms allow extreme rear fuselage variety purposes. Wings vs. bodies Flying A flying tailless aircraft definite fuselage. Most crew, payload equipment housed inside structure.The flying configuration studied extensively 1930s 1940s, notably Jack Northrop Cheston L. Eshelman United States, Alexander Lippisch Horten brothers Germany. After war, number experimental designs based flying concept, difficulties remained intractable. Some general interest continued 1950s designs offer great advantage range presented number technical problems, leading adoption "conventional" solutions Convair B-36 B-52 Stratofortress. Due practical deep wing, flying concept practical designs slow-to-medium speed range, continual interest tactical airlifter design.Interest flying wings renewed 1980s radar reflection cross-sections. Stealth technology relies shapes reflect radar waves directions, making aircraft detect radar receiver position aircraft position changes continuously aircraft moves. This approach eventually led Northrop B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. In case aerodynamic advantages flying primary needs. However, modern computer-controlled fly-by-wire systems allowed aerodynamic drawbacks flying minimized, making efficient stable long-range bomber. Blended Blended aircraft flattened airfoil shaped body, produces lift aloft, distinct separate structures, wings smoothly blended body.Thus blended bodied aircraft incorporate design features futuristic fuselage flying design. The purported advantages blended approach efficient high-lift wings airfoil-shaped body. This enables entire craft contribute lift generation increased fuel economy. Lifting A lifting configuration produces lift. In contrast flying wing, minimal conventional fuselage, lifting thought fuselage conventional wing. Whereas flying seeks maximize cruise efficiency subsonic speeds eliminating non-lifting surfaces, lifting bodies generally minimize drag structure subsonic, supersonic, hypersonic flight, or, spacecraft re-entry. All flight regimes pose challenges proper flight stability.Lifting bodies major area 1960s 70s build small lightweight manned spacecraft. The US built number famous lifting rocket planes test concept, well rocket-launched re-entry vehicles tested Pacific. Interest waned US Air Force lost interest manned mission, major development ended Space Shuttle design process clear highly shaped fuselages difficult fit fuel tankage. Empennage foreplane The classic airfoil unstable flight difficult control. Flexible-wing types anchor weight pilot hanging beneath maintain correct attitude. Some free-flying types adapted airfoil stable, ingenious mechanisms including, recently, electronic artificial stability.But order achieve trim, stability control, fixed-wing types empennage comprising fin rudder horizontally tailplane elevator vertically. This common conventional layout. Sometimes fins, spaced tailplane.Some types horizontal "canard" foreplane ahead wing, it. This foreplane contribute lift, trim, control aircraft, these. Controls instruments Airplanes complex flight control systems. The controls allow pilot direct aircraft air controlling attitude (roll, pitch yaw) engine thrust.On manned aircraft, cockpit instruments pilots, including flight data, engine output, navigation, communications aircraft systems installed. Safety When risk measured deaths passenger kilometer, air travel 10 safer travel bus rail. However, deaths journey statistic, air travel dangerous car, rail, bus travel. Air travel insurance expensive reason- insurers generally deaths journey statistic. There difference safety airliners smaller private planes, per-mile statistic indicating airliners 8.3 safer smaller planes.

Animation process making illusion motion illusion change rapid display sequence images minimally other. The illusion—as motion pictures general—is thought phi phenomenon. Animators artists specialize creation animation. Animation recorded analogue media, flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats animated GIF, Flash animation, digital video. To display animation, digital camera, computer, projector technologies produced.Animation creation methods include traditional animation creation method involving motion animation three-dimensional objects, paper cutouts, puppets clay figures. Images displayed rapid succession, 24, 25, 30, 60 frames second. Computer animation processes generating animated images general term computer-generated imagery (CGI). 3D animation computer graphics, 2D animation stylistic, bandwidth faster real-time renderings. History Early examples attempts capture phenomenon motion drawing paleolithic cave paintings, animals depicted multiple legs superimposed positions, clearly attempting convey perception motion.An earthen goblet discovered site 5,200-year-old Shahr-e Sūkhté (Burnt City) southeastern Iran, depicts world's oldest example animation. The artifact bears sequential images depicting Persian Desert Ibex jumping eat leaves tree.Ancient Chinese records mentions devices "give impression movement" human animal figures, accounts unclear refer movement figures space. They may, course, refer Chinese shadow puppets.In 19th century, phenakistoscope (1832), zoetrope (1834) praxinoscope (1877) introduced. A thaumatrope (1824) simple toy small disk pictures side; bird cage attached pieces strings. The phenakistoscope invented simultaneously Belgian Joseph Plateau Austrian Simon von Stampfer 1831. The phenakistoscope consists disk series images, drawn radi evenly space center disk.John Barnes Linnett patented flip book 1868 kineograph. The common flip book animation devices produced illusion movement series sequential drawings, animation develop advent motion picture film cinematography 1890s.The cinématographe projector, printer, camera machine allowed moving pictures screen invented history's earliest filmmakers, Auguste Louis Lumière, 1894. The animated projection (screening) created France, Charles-Émile Reynaud, French science teacher. Reynaud created Praxinoscope 1877 Théâtre Optique December 1888. On 28 October 1892, projected animation public, Pauvre Pierrot, Musée Grévin Paris. This film notable instance film perforations used. His films photographed, drawn directly transparent strip. In 1900, 500,000 people attended screenings.The film recorded standard picture film included animated sequences 1900 Enchanted Drawing, entirely animated film 1906 Humorous Phases Funny Faces J. Stuart Blackton, who, that, considered father American animation.In Europe, French artist, Émile Cohl, created animated film traditional animation creation methods 1908 Fantasmagorie. The film consisted stick figure moving encountering manner morphing objects, wine bottle transforms flower. There sections live action animator's hands enter scene. The film created drawing frame paper shooting frame negative film, picture blackboard look.The author puppet-animated film (The Beautiful Lukanida (1912)) Russian-born (ethnically Polish) director Wladyslaw Starewicz, Ladislas Starevich.More detailed hand-drawn animation, requiring team animators drawing frame manually detailed backgrounds characters, directed Winsor McCay, newspaper cartoonist, including 1911 Little Nemo, 1914 Gertie Dinosaur, 1918 The Sinking Lusitania. Gertie Dinosaur example character development drawn animation.During 1910s, production animated short films typically referred "cartoons", industry cartoon shorts produced showing movie theaters. The producer John Randolph Bray, who, animator Earl Hurd, patented cel animation process dominated animation industry rest decade.El Apóstol (Spanish: "The Apostle") 1917 Argentine animated film utilizing cutout animation, world's animated feature film. Unfortunately, fire destroyed producer Federico Valle's film studio incinerated copy El Apóstol, considered lost film.In 1958, Hanna-Barbera released Huckleberry Hound, half hour television program feature animation. Terrytoons released Tom Terrific year. Television decreased public attention animated shorts theaters.Computer animation popular Toy Story (1995), feature-length animated film completely technique.In 2008, animation market worth US$68.4 billion. Animation industry continues thrive mid-2010s well-made animated projects find audiences borders quadrants. Animated feature-length films returned highest gross margins (around 52%) film genres 2004–2013 timeframe. Techniques Traditional animation Traditional animation (also called cel animation hand-drawn animation) process animated films 20th century. The individual frames traditionally animated film photographs drawings, drawn paper. To create illusion movement, drawing differs it. The animators' drawings traced photocopied transparent acetate sheets called cels, filled paints assigned colors tones opposite drawings. The completed character cels photographed one-by-one painted background rostrum camera motion picture film.The traditional cel animation process obsolete 21st century. Today, animators' drawings backgrounds scanned drawn directly computer system. Various software programs color drawings simulate camera movement effects. The final animated piece output delivery media, including traditional 35 film newer digital video. The "look" traditional cel animation preserved, character animators' work remained essentially 70 years. Some animation producers term "tradigital" (a play "traditional" "digital") describe cel animation extensive computer technologies.Examples traditionally animated feature films include Pinocchio (United States, 1940), Animal Farm (United Kingdom, 1954), The Illusionist (British-French, 2010). Traditionally animated films produced computer technology include The Lion King (US, 1994), The Prince Egypt (US, 1998), Akira (Japan, 1988), Spirited Away (Japan, 2001), The Triplets Belleville (France, 2003), The Secret Kells (Irish-French-Belgian, 2009).Full animation refers process producing high-quality traditionally animated films regularly detailed drawings plausible movement, smooth animation. Fully animated films variety styles, realistically animated works produced Walt Disney studio (The Little Mermaid, Beauty Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King) 'cartoon' styles Warner Bros. animation studio. Many Disney animated features examples animation, non-Disney works, The Secret NIMH (US, 1982), The Iron Giant (US, 1999), Nocturna (Spain, 2007). Fully animated films animated 24 frames second, combination animation twos, meaning drawings held frame 24 frames 24.Limited animation involves detailed stylized drawings methods movement choppy "skippy" movement animation. Limited animation fewer drawings second, limiting fluidity animation. This economic technique. Pioneered artists American studio United Productions America, limited animation method stylized artistic expression, Gerald McBoing-Boing (US, 1951), Yellow Submarine (UK, 1968), anime produced Japan. Its primary use, however, producing cost-effective animated content television (the work Hanna-Barbera, Filmation, TV animation studios) Internet (web cartoons).Rotoscoping technique patented Max Fleischer 1917 animators trace live-action movement, frame frame. The source film directly copied actors' outlines animated drawings, The Lord Rings (US, 1978), stylized expressive manner, Waking Life (US, 2001) A Scanner Darkly (US, 2006). Some examples Fire Ice (US, 1983), Heavy Metal (1981), Aku Hana (2013).Live-action/animation technique combining hand-drawn characters live action shots live action actors animated shots. One earlier Koko Clown Koko drawn live action footage. Other examples include Who Framed Roger Rabbit (US, 1988), Space Jam (US, 1996) Osmosis Jones (US, 2001). Stop motion animation Stop-motion animation describe animation created physically manipulating real-world objects photographing frame film create illusion movement. There types stop-motion animation, named medium create animation. Computer software create type animation; however, traditional motion animation expensive time-consuming produce current computer animation.Puppet animation typically involves stop-motion puppet figures interacting constructed environment, contrast real-world interaction model animation. The puppets generally armature inside steady constrain motion joints. Examples include The Tale Fox (France, 1937), The Nightmare Before Christmas (US, 1993), Corpse Bride (US, 2005), Coraline (US, 2009), films Jiří Trnka adult animated sketch-comedy television series Robot Chicken (US, 2005–present).Puppetoon, created techniques developed George Pal, puppet-animated films typically version puppet frames, simply manipulating existing puppet.Clay animation, Plasticine animation (often called claymation, which, however, trademarked name), figures clay malleable material create stop-motion animation. The figures armature wire frame inside, puppet animation (below), manipulated pose figures. Alternatively, figures entirely clay, films Bruce Bickford, clay creatures morph variety shapes. Examples clay-animated works include The Gumby Show (US, 1957–1967) Morph shorts (UK, 1977–2000), Wallace Gromit shorts (UK, 1989), Jan Švankmajer's Dimensions Dialogue (Czechoslovakia, 1982), The Trap Door (UK, 1984). Films include Wallace & Gromit: The Curse Were-Rabbit, Chicken Run The Adventures Mark Twain.Strata-cut animation, Strata-cut animation commonly clay animation bread-like "loaf" clay, internally packed tight loaded varying imagery, sliced sheets, animation camera frame loaf cut, eventually revealing movement internal images within.Cutout animation type stop-motion animation produced moving two-dimensional pieces material paper cloth. Examples include Terry Gilliam's animated sequences Monty Python's Flying Circus (UK, 1969–1974); Fantastic Planet (France/Czechoslovakia, 1973) ; Tale Tales (Russia, 1979), The pilot episode adult television sitcom series (and episodes) South Park (US, 1997) music video Live moment, Verona Riots band (produced Alberto Serrano Nívola Uyá, Spain 2014).Silhouette animation variant cutout animation characters backlit visible silhouettes. Examples include The Adventures Prince Achmed (Weimar Republic, 1926) Princes princesses (France, 2000).Model animation refers stop-motion animation created interact exist live-action world. Intercutting, matte effects split screens employed blend stop-motion characters objects live actors settings. Examples include work Ray Harryhausen, films, Jason Argonauts (1963), work Willis H. O'Brien films, King Kong (1933).Go motion variant model animation techniques create motion blur frames film, traditional stop-motion. The technique invented Industrial Light & Magic Phil Tippett create scenes film The Empire Strikes Back (1980). Another example dragon named "Vermithrax" Dragonslayer (1981 film).Object animation refers regular inanimate objects stop-motion animation, opposed created items.Graphic animation non-drawn flat visual graphic material (photographs, newspaper clippings, magazines, etc.), manipulated frame-by-frame create movement. At times, graphics remain stationary, stop-motion camera moved create on-screen action.Brickfilm subgenre object animation involving Lego brick toys animation. These boost popularity advent video sharing sites, YouTube availability cheap cameras animation software.Pixilation involves live humans motion characters. This allows number surreal effects, including disappearances reappearances, allowing people appear slide ground, effects. Examples pixilation include The Secret Adventures Tom Thumb Angry Kid shorts. Computer animation Computer animation encompasses variety techniques, unifying factor animation created digitally computer. 2D animation techniques focus image manipulation 3D techniques build virtual worlds characters objects move interact. 3D animation create images viewer. 2D animation 2D animation figures created edited computer 2D bitmap graphics created edited 2D vector graphics. This includes automated computerized versions traditional animation techniques, interpolated morphing, onion skinning interpolated rotoscoping.2D animation applications, including analog computer animation, Flash animation, PowerPoint animation. Cinemagraphs photographs animated GIF file animated.Final advection animation technique 2D animation, artists animators influence control final product department. Speaking approach Paperman, John Kahrs "Our animators change things, erase CG underlayer want, change profile arm." 3D animation 3D animation digitally modeled manipulated animator. The animator starts creating 3D polygon mesh manipulate. A mesh typically includes vertices connected edges faces, visual appearance 3D object 3D environment. Sometimes, mesh internal digital skeletal structure called armature control mesh weighting vertices. This process called rigging conjunction keyframes create movement.Other techniques applied, mathematical functions (e.g., gravity, particle simulations), simulated hair, effects, fire water simulations. These techniques fall category 3D dynamics. 3D terms Cel-shaded animation mimic traditional animation computer software. Shading stark, blending colors. Examples include Skyland (2007, France), The Iron Giant (1999, United States), Futurama (Fox, 1999) Appleseed Ex Machina (2007, Japan), The Legend Zelda: The Wind Waker (2002, Japan)Machinima – Films created screen capturing video games virtual worlds.Motion capture live-action actors wear suits allow computers copy movements CG characters. Examples include Polar Express (2004, US), Beowulf (2007, US), A Christmas Carol (2009, US), The Adventures Tintin (film) (2011, US) kochadiiyan (2014, India).Photo-realistic animation animation attempts resemble life, advanced rendering mimics detail skin, plants, water, fire, clouds, etc. Examples include Up (2009, US), How Train Your Dragon (2010, US), Ice Age (2002, US). Mechanical animation Animatronics mechatronics create machines animate robotic.Audio-Animatronics Autonomatronics robotics animation, combined 3-D animation, created Walt Disney Imagineering attractions Disney theme parks move noise (generally recorded speech song). They fixed supports them. They sit stand, walk. An Audio-Animatron android-type robot prerecorded movements sounds, responding external stimuli. In 2009, Disney created interactive version technology called Autonomatronics.Linear Animation Generator animation static picture frames installed tunnel shaft. The animation illusion created putting viewer linear motion, parallel installed picture frames. The concept technical solution invented 2007 Mihai Girlovan Romania.Chuckimation type animation created makers television series Action League Now! characters/props thrown, chucked camera wiggled simulate talking unseen hands.Puppetry theatre performance animation involves manipulation puppets. It ancient believed originated 3000 years BC. Puppetry takes forms, share process animating inanimate performing objects. Puppetry human societies entertainment – performance – ceremonially rituals, celebrations, carnivals. Most puppetry involves storytelling.Zoetrope device produces illusion motion rapid succession static pictures. The term zoetrope Greek ζωή (zoē), meaning "alive, active", τρόπος (tropos), meaning "turn", "zoetrope" "active turn" "wheel life". Other animation styles, techniques, approaches Hydrotechnics: technique includes lights, water, fire, fog, lasers, high-definition projections mist screens.Drawn film animation: technique footage produced creating images directly film stock, example Norman McLaren, Len Lye Stan Brakhage.Paint-on-glass animation: technique making animated films manipulating slow drying oil paints sheets glass, example Aleksandr Petrov.Erasure animation: technique traditional 2D media, photographed artist manipulates image. For example, William Kentridge famous charcoal erasure films, Piotr Dumała auteur technique animating scratches plaster.Pinscreen animation: screen filled movable pins moved pressing object screen. The screen pins cast shadows. The technique create animated films range textural effects difficult achieve traditional cel animation.Sand animation: moved back- front-lighted piece glass create frame animated film. This creates interesting animated contrast.Flip book: flip book (sometimes, British English, called flick book) book series pictures vary gradually next, turned rapidly, pictures appear animate simulating motion change. Flip books illustrated books children, geared adults employ series photographs drawings. Flip books separate books, appear feature ordinary books magazines, corners. Software packages websites convert digital video files custom-made flip books.Character animationMulti-sketchingSpecial effects animation Production The creation non-trivial animation works (i.e., longer seconds) developed filmmaking, unique aspects. One live-action animated feature-length films common extremely labor-intensive high production costs.The difference film production phase, marginal cost shot higher animated films live-action films. It easy director principal photography live-action film, animated film manually rendered animators (although task rendering takes tedious modern computer animation). It pointless studio pay salaries dozens animators spend weeks creating visually dazzling five-minute scene scene fails effectively advance plot film. Thus, animation studios starting Disney began practice 1930s maintaining story departments storyboard artists develop single scene storyboards, handing film animators production team satisfied scenes sense whole. While live-action films storyboarded, enjoy latitude depart storyboards (i.e., real-time improvisation).Another problem unique animation necessity ensuring style animated film consistent start finish, films grown longer teams grown larger. Animators, artists, individual styles, subordinate individuality consistent style selected film. Since 1980s, feature-length animated films created teams 500 600 people, 50 70 animators. It easy three artists match other's styles; harder dozens artists synchronized another.This problem solved separate group visual development artists develop palette film animation begins. Character designers visual development team draw model sheets character facial expressions, posed positions, viewed angles. On traditionally animated projects, maquettes sculpted help animators characters angles.Unlike live-action films, animated films traditionally developed synopsis stage storyboard format; storyboard artists receive credit writing film. In 1960s, animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters write screenplays (while continuing story departments) screenplays commonplace animated films 1980s. Criticism Criticism animation common cinema inception. With popularity, amount criticism arisen, animated feature-length films. Many concerns cultural representation, psychological effects children brought animation industry, remained politically unchanged stagnant inception mainstream culture.Certain under-representation women criticized animation films industry.

A ship watercraft travels world's oceans deep waterways, carrying passengers goods, support specialized missions, defense, fishing. Historically, "ship" sailing vessel three square-rigged masts bowsprit. Ships generally distinguished boats, based size, shape load capacity.Ships contributors human migration commerce. They supported spread colonization slave trade, served scientific, cultural, humanitarian needs. After 16th century, crops Americas European seafarers contributed population growth. Ship transport responsible largest portion commerce.As 2016, 49,000 merchant ships, totaling 1.8 billion dead weight tons. Of 28% oil tankers, 43% bulk carriers, 13% container ships. Military forces operate vessels naval warfare transport support forces ashore. As 2016, world's 104 navies, Korean People's Navy North Korea surface vessels (967), People's Liberation Army Navy China (714), United States Navy (415), Islamic Republic Iran Navy (398), Russian Navy (352). The 50 navies median fleet 88 surface vessels each, sources. Nomenclature There universal definition distinguishes ship boat. Ships distinguished boats based size ship's ability operate independently extended periods. A legal definition ship Indian case law vessel carries goods sea. A common notion ship carry boat, vice versa. A US Navy rule thumb ships heel sharp turn, boats heel inside location center mass versus center buoyancy. American British 19th Century maritime law distinguished "vessels" craft; ships boats fall legal category, open boats rafts considered vessels.In Age Sail, full-rigged ship sailing vessel three square-rigged masts bowsprit; types vessel defined sailplan, e.g. barque, brigantine, etc.A number vessels referred boats. Submarines prime example. Other types vessel traditionally called boats Great Lakes freighters, riverboats, ferryboats. Though carry boats heavy cargoes, vessels designed operation inland protected coastal waters.In maritime traditions ships individual names, modern ships belong ship class named ship. In English, ship traditionally referred "she", named man, universal usage; journalistic style guides advise "it" referring ships female pronouns offensive outdated. History Prehistory antiquity The vessels 10,000 years ago, described ships. The navigators began animal skins woven fabrics sails. Affixed pole set upright boat, sails ships range. This allowed men explore widely, allowing settlement Oceania example (about 3,000 years ago).By 3000 BC, Ancient Egyptians knew assemble wooden planks hull. They woven straps lash planks together, reeds grass stuffed planks helped seal seams. The Greek historian geographer Agatharchides documented ship-faring Egyptians: "During prosperous period Old Kingdom, 30th 25th centuries B. C., river-routes order, Egyptian ships sailed Red Sea myrrh-country." Sneferu's ancient cedar wood ship Praise Two Lands reference recorded (2613 BC) ship referred name.The ancient Egyptians perfectly building sailboats. A remarkable example shipbuilding skills Khufu ship, vessel 143 feet (44 m) length entombed foot Great Pyramid Giza 2500 BC intact 1954.It ancient Nubia/Axum traded India, evidence ships Northeast Africa sailed India/Sri Lanka Nubia trading goods Persia, Himyar Rome. Aksum Greeks seaports ships Greece Yemen.Elsewhere Northeast Africa, Periplus Red Sea reports Somalis, northern ports Zeila Berbera, trading frankincense items inhabitants Arabian Peninsula well arrival Islam well Roman-controlled Egypt.A panel Mohenjodaro depicted sailing craft. Vessels types; construction vividly described Yukti Kalpa Taru, ancient Indian text shipbuilding. This treatise technical exposition techniques shipbuilding. It sets minute details types ships, sizes, materials built. The Yukti Kalpa Taru sums condensed information. The Yukti Kalpa Taru dates prove that, ancient times, Indian shipbuilders good knowledge materials building ships. In addition describing qualities types wood suitability shipbuilding, Yukti Kalpa Taru elaborate classification ships based size.The oldest discovered faring hulled boat Late Bronze Age Uluburun shipwreck coast Turkey, dating 1300 BC.The Phoenicians, sail completely Africa, Greeks gradually mastered navigation aboard triremes, exploring colonizing Mediterranean ship. Around 340 BC, Greek navigator Pytheas Massalia ventured Greece Western Europe Great Britain. In course 2nd century BC, Rome destroy Carthage subdue Hellenistic kingdoms eastern Mediterranean, achieving complete mastery inland sea, called Mare Nostrum. The monsoon wind system Indian Ocean sailed Greek navigator Eudoxus Cyzicus 118 BC.In China, Zhou Dynasty ship technologies stern mounted rudders developed, Han Dynasty, well naval fleet integral military. Ship technology advanced point medieval period, water tight compartments developed.The Swahili people extensive trading ports dotting coast medieval East Africa Great Zimbabwe extensive trading contacts Central Africa, imported goods brought Africa Southeast African shore trade Kilwa modern-day Tanzania.It historians height Mali Empire built naval fleet Emperor Mansa Musa 13th 14th century. Arabic sources describe consider visits New World Mali fleet 1311.Before introduction compass, celestial navigation method navigation sea. In China, versions magnetic compass developed navigation 1040 1117. The true mariner's compass, pivoting needle dry box, developed Europe 1300. Renaissance Until Renaissance, navigational technology remained comparatively primitive. This absence technology prevent civilizations powers. Examples include maritime republics Genoa Venice, Hanseatic League, Byzantine navy. The Vikings knarrs explore North America[citation needed][dubious], trade Baltic Sea plunder coastal regions Western Europe.Towards 14th century, ships carrack began develop towers bow stern. These towers decreased vessel's stability, 15th century, caravel, designed Portuguese, based Arabic qarib sail closer wind, used. The towers gradually replaced forecastle sterncastle, carrack Santa María Christopher Columbus. This increased freeboard allowed innovation: freeing port, artillery associated it.In 16th century, freeboard freeing ports widespread galleons.At time, ships developing Asia Europe. Japan defensive naval techniques Mongol invasions Japan 1281. It Mongols advantage European Asian shipbuilding techniques. During 15th century, China's Ming Dynasty assembled largest powerful naval fleets diplomatic power projection voyages Zheng He. Elsewhere Japan 15th century, world's iron-clads, "Tekkōsen" (鉄甲船), literally meaning "iron ships", developed. In Japan, Sengoku fifteenth 17th century, great struggle feudal supremacy fought, part, coastal fleets boats, including atakebune. In Korea, 15th century Joseon era, "Geobukseon"(거북선), developed. The "turtle ship", called recognized armored ship world.During Age Ajuran, Somali sultanates republics Merca, Mogadishu, Barawa, Hobyo ports flourished, enjoying lucrative foreign commerce ships sailing Arabia, India, Venetia, Persia, Egypt, Portugal China. In 16th century, Duarte Barbosa ships Kingdom Cambaya modern-day India sailed Mogadishu cloth spices, return received gold, wax ivory. Barbosa highlighted abundance meat, wheat, barley, horses, fruit coastal markets, generated enormous wealth merchants.Middle Age Swahili Kingdoms trade bullship trade routes Islamic Asia described Greek historians "metropolises". Famous African trade ports Mombasa, Zanzibar, Kilwa Chinese sailors Zheng He medieval Islamic historians Berber Islamic voyager Abu Abdullah ibn Battua. In 14th century AD, King Abubakari I, brother King Mansa Musa Mali Empire, thought great armada ships sitting coast West Africa. This corroborated ibn Battuta recalls Malian ships coast. This led great speculation, historical evidence, Malian sailors reached coast Pre-Columbian America rule Abubakari II, years Christopher Columbus black traders Americas Columbus. Fifty years Christopher Columbus, Chinese navigator Zheng He traveled head huge armada. The largest ships masts, 130 metres (430 ft) beam 55 metres (180 ft). His fleet carried 30,000 men aboard 70 vessels, goal bringing glory Chinese emperor.At Zheng He expedition, Portuguese explorer Gil Eanes sailed square-rigged caravel Cape Bojador considered opening route deep exploration, continental communication technology spherical earth principle.The carrack caravel developed Portugal. After Columbus, European exploration rapidly accelerated, trade routes established. In 1498, reaching India, Vasco Gama proved access Indian Ocean Atlantic possible. These explorations Atlantic Indian Oceans France, England Netherlands, explored Portuguese Spanish trade routes Pacific Ocean, reaching Australia 1606 New Zealand 1642. In 17th century Dutch Spanish explorers Abel Tasman Luís Vaz Torres explored coasts Australia, 18th century British explorer James Cook mapped Polynesia.

Mercantile trade hand-in-hand exploration, self-financed commercial benefits exploration.During half 18th century, French Navy began develop type vessel ship line, featuring seventy-four guns. This type ship backbone European fighting fleets. These ships 56 metres (184 ft) construction required 2,800 oak trees 40 kilometres (25 mi) rope; carried crew 800 sailors soldiers.During 19th century Royal Navy enforced ban slave trade, acted suppress piracy, continued map world. A clipper fast sailing ship 19th century. The clipper routes fell commercial disuse introduction steam ships better fuel efficiency, opening Suez Panama Canals.Ship designs stayed fairly unchanged 19th century. The industrial revolution, mechanical methods propulsion, ability construct ships metal triggered explosion ship design. Factors including quest efficient ships, running wasteful maritime conflicts, increased financial capacity industrial powers created avalanche specialized boats ships. Ships built entirely functions, firefighting, rescue, research, began appear.In this, classification vessels type function difficult. Even broad functional classifications fishery, trade, military, exploration fails classify ships. This difficulty increased fact terms sloop frigate ships alike, modern vessels common predecessors. 21st century In 2007, world's fleet included 34,882 commercial vessels gross tonnage 1,000 tons, totaling 1.04 billion tons. These ships carried 7.4 billion tons cargo 2006, sum grew 8% year. In terms tonnage, 39% ships tankers, 26% bulk carriers, 17% container ships 15% types.In 2002, 1,240 warships operating world, counting small vessels patrol boats. The United States accounted 3 tons worth vessels, Russia 1.35 tons, United Kingdom 504,660 tons China 402,830 tons. The 20th century naval engagements wars, Cold War, power naval forces blocs. The world's major powers naval power cases United Kingdom Falkland Islands United States Iraq.The size world's fishing fleet difficult estimate. The largest counted commercial vessels, smallest legion. Fishing vessels seaside villages world. As 2004, United Nations Food Agriculture Organization estimated 4 fishing vessels operating worldwide. The study estimated world's 29 fishermen caught 85,800,000 tonnes (84,400,000 tons; 94,600,000 short tons) fish shellfish year. Types ships Because ships constructed principles naval architecture require structural components, classification based function suggested Paulet Presles, requires modification components. The categories accepted general naval architects are:High-speed craft – Multihulls including wave piercers, small-waterplane-area twin hull (SWATH), surface ships hovercraft, hydrofoil, ground craft (WIG).Off shore oil vessels – Platform supply vessel, pipe layers, accommodation crane barges, semi-submersible drilling rigs, production platforms, floating production storage offloading units.Fishing vesselsMotorised fishing trawlers, trap setters, seiners, longliners, trollers & factory ships.Traditional sailing rowed fishing vessels boats handline fishingHarbour work craftCable layersTugboats, dredgers, salvage vessels, tenders, Pilot boats.Floating dry docks, floating cranes, lightership.Dry cargo ships – tramp freighters, bulk carriers, cargo liners, container vessels, barge carriers, Ro-Ro ships, refrigerated cargo ships, timber carriers, livestock & vehicle carriers.Liquid cargo ships – Oil tankers, liquefied gas carriers, chemical carriers.Passenger vesselsLiners, cruise Special Trade Passenger (STP) shipsCross-channel, coastal harbour ferries.Luxury & cruising yachtsSail training multi-masted shipsRecreational boats craft – rowed, masted motorised craftSpecial-purpose vessels – weather vessels, deep survey vessels, icebreakers.Submersibles – industrial exploration, scientific research, tourist hydrographic survey.WarshipsSurface combatant- deep shallow draftSubmarinesSome discussed sections. Freshwater Freshwater shipping occur lakes, rivers canals. Ships designed venues adapted widths depths waterways. Examples freshwater waterways navigable vessels include Danube, Mississippi, Rhine, Yangtze Amazon Rivers, Great Lakes. Great Lakes Lake freighters, called lakers, cargo vessels ply Great Lakes. The well-known SS Edmund Fitzgerald, latest major vessel wrecked Lakes. These vessels traditionally called boats, ships. Visiting ocean-going vessels called "salties." Because additional beam, salties inland Saint Lawrence Seaway. Because smallest Soo Locks larger Seaway lock, salties pass Seaway travel Great Lakes. Because deeper draft, salties accept partial loads Great Lakes, "topping off" exited Seaway. Similarly, largest lakers confined Upper Lakes (Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie) Seaway locks, Welland Canal bypasses Niagara River.Since freshwater lakes corrosive ships salt water oceans, lakers longer ocean freighters. Lakers older 50 years unusual, 2005, 20 years age.SS St. Marys Challenger, built 1906 William P Snyder, oldest laker working Lakes conversion barge starting 2013. Similarly, E.M. Ford, built 1898 Presque Isle, sailing lakes 98 years 1996. As 2007 E.M. Ford afloat stationary transfer vessel riverside cement silo Saginaw, Michigan. Seagoing commercial vessels Commercial vessels merchant ships divided broad categories: fishing, cargo ships, passenger ships, special-purpose ships. The UNCTAD review maritime transport categorizes ships as: oil tankers, bulk (and combination) carriers, general cargo ships, container ships, "other ships", includes "liquefied petroleum gas carriers, liquefied natural gas carriers, parcel (chemical) tankers, specialized tankers, reefers, offshore supply, tugs, dredgers, cruise, ferries, non-cargo". General cargo ships include "multi-purpose project vessels roll-on/roll-off cargo".Modern commercial vessels typically powered single propeller driven diesel or, usually, gas turbine engine., mid-19th century square sail rigged. The fastest vessels pump-jet engines. Most commercial vessels hull-forms maximize cargo capacity. Hulls steel, aluminum faster craft, fiberglass smallest service vessels. Commercial vessels generally crew headed captain, deck officers marine engineers larger vessels. Special-purpose vessels specialized crew necessary, example scientists aboard vessels.Fishing boats generally small, 30 meters (98 ft) 100 metres (330 ft) whaling ship. Aboard fish processing vessel, catch market sold ship port. Special purpose vessels gear. For example, trawlers winches arms, stern-trawlers rear ramp, seiners skiffs. In 2004, 85,800,000 tonnes (84,400,000 tons; 94,600,000 short tons) fish caught marine capture fishery. Anchoveta represented largest single catch 10,700,000 tonnes (10,500,000 tons; 11,800,000 short tons). That year, marine capture species included Alaska pollock, Blue whiting, Skipjack tuna, Atlantic herring, Chub mackerel, Japanese anchovy, Chilean jack mackerel, Largehead hairtail, Yellowfin tuna. Other species including salmon, shrimp, lobster, clams, squid crab, commercially fished. Modern commercial fishermen methods. One fishing nets, purse seine, beach seine, lift nets, gillnets, entangling nets. Another trawling, including bottom trawl. Hooks lines methods long-line fishing hand-line fishing. Another method fishing trap.Cargo ships transport dry liquid cargo. Dry cargo transported bulk bulk carriers, packed directly general cargo ship break-bulk, packed intermodal containers aboard container ship, driven aboard roll-on roll-off ships. Liquid cargo generally carried bulk aboard tankers, oil tankers include crude finished products oil, chemical tankers carry vegetable oils chemicals LPG/LNG tankers, smaller shipments carried container ships tank containers.Passenger ships range size small river ferries cruise ships. This type vessel includes ferries, move passengers vehicles short trips; ocean liners, carry passengers another; cruise ships, carry passengers voyages undertaken pleasure, visiting places leisure activities board, returning embarkation. Riverboats inland ferries designed carry passengers, cargo, challenging river environment. Rivers hazards vessels. They varying water flows alternately lead high speed water flows protruding rock hazards. Changing siltation patterns sudden appearance shoal waters, floating sunken logs trees (called snags) endanger hulls propulsion riverboats. Riverboats generally shallow draft, broad beam square plan, freeboard high topsides. Riverboats survive type configuration withstand high winds waves lakes, seas, oceans.Fishing vessels subset commercial vessels, generally small size subject regulations classification. They categorized criteria: architecture, type fish catch, fishing method used, geographical origin, technical features rigging. As 2004, world's fishing fleet consisted 4 vessels. Of these, 1.3 decked vessels enclosed areas rest open vessels. Most decked vessels mechanized, two-thirds open vessels traditional craft propelled sails oars. More 60% existing fishing vessels built Japan, Peru, Russian Federation, Spain United States America. Special purpose vessels A weather ship ship stationed ocean platform surface upper air meteorological observations marine weather forecasting. Surface weather observations hourly, radiosonde releases occurred daily. It rescue operations support transatlantic flights. Proposed 1927 aviation community, establishment weather ships proved World War II International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established global network weather ships 1948, 13 supplied United States. This number eventually negotiated nine.The weather ship crews three weeks time, returning 10-day stretches. Weather ship observations proved helpful wind wave studies, avoid weather systems ships tended safety reasons. They helpful monitoring storms sea, tropical cyclones. The removal weather ship negative factor forecasts leading Great Storm 1987. Beginning 1970s, role superseded weather buoys ships' cost. The agreement weather ships international community ended 1990. The weather ship Polarfront, weather station M ("Mike"), operation 1 January 2010. Weather observations ships continue fleet voluntary merchant vessels routine commercial operation. Naval vessels Naval vessels navy military purposes. There types naval vessel. Modern naval vessels broken three categories: surface warships, submarines, support auxiliary vessels.Modern warships generally divided categories: aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, corvettes, submarines amphibious assault ships. The distinction cruisers, destroyers, frigates, corvettes rigorous; vessel described differently navies. Battleships Second World War occasionally (the battleships removed U.S. Naval Vessel Register March 2006), obsolete carrier-borne aircraft guided missiles.Most military submarines attack submarines ballistic missile submarines. Until World War II primary role diesel/electric submarine anti-ship warfare, inserting removing covert agents military forces, intelligence-gathering. With development homing torpedo, better sonar systems, nuclear propulsion, submarines effectively hunt other. The development submarine-launched nuclear cruise missiles submarines long-ranged ability attack land targets variety weapons ranging cluster munitions nuclear weapons.Most navies include types support auxiliary vessel, minesweepers, patrol boats, offshore patrol vessels, replenishment ships, hospital ships designated medical treatment facilities.Fast combat vessels cruisers destroyers fine hulls maximize speed maneuverability. They advanced marine electronics communication systems, well weapons. Architecture Some components exist vessels size purpose. Every vessel hull sorts. Every vessel sort propulsion, pole, ox, nuclear reactor. Most vessels sort steering system. Other characteristics common, universal, compartments, holds, superstructure, equipment anchors winches. Hull For ship float, weight water displaced ship's hull. There types hulls, logs lashed raft advanced hulls America's Cup sailboats. A vessel single hull (called monohull design), case catamarans, three case trimarans. Vessels three hulls rare, experiments conducted designs pentamarans. Multiple hulls generally parallel connected rigid arms.Hulls elements. The bow foremost hull. Many ships feature bulbous bow. The keel bottom hull, extending entire length ship. The rear hull stern, hulls flat transom. Common hull appendages include propellers propulsion, rudders steering, stabilizers quell ship's rolling motion. Other hull features vessel's work, fishing gear sonar domes.Hulls subject hydrostatic hydrodynamic constraints. The hydrostatic constraint support entire weight boat, maintain stability unevenly distributed weight. Hydrodynamic constraints include ability withstand shock waves, weather collisions groundings.Older ships pleasure craft wooden hulls. Steel commercial vessels. Aluminium frequently fast vessels, composite materials sailboats pleasure craft. Some ships concrete hulls. Propulsion systems Propulsion systems ships fall three categories: human propulsion, sailing, mechanical propulsion. Human propulsion includes rowing, galleys. Propulsion sail generally consists sail hoisted erect mast, supported stays spars controlled ropes. Sail systems propulsion 19th century. They generally recreation competition, experimental sail systems, turbosails, rotorsails, wingsails larger modern vessels fuel savings.Mechanical propulsion systems generally consist motor engine turning propeller, frequently, impeller wave propulsion fins. Steam engines purpose, replaced two-stroke four-stroke diesel engines, outboard motors, gas turbine engines faster ships. Nuclear reactors producing steam propel warships icebreakers, attempts utilize power commercial vessels (see NS Savannah).In addition traditional fixed controllable pitch propellers specialized variations, contra-rotating nozzle-style propellers. Most vessels single propeller, vessels propellers supplemented transverse thrusters maneuvring ports. The propeller connected engine propeller shaft and, case medium- high-speed engines, reduction gearbox. Some modern vessels diesel-electric powertrain propeller turned electric motor powered ship's generators. Steering systems For ships independent propulsion systems side, manual oars paddles, steering systems necessary. In designs, boats propelled engines sails, steering system necessary. The common rudder, submerged plane located rear hull. Rudders rotated generate lateral force turns boat. Rudders rotated tiller, manual wheels, electro-hydraulic systems. Autopilot systems combine mechanical rudders navigation systems. Ducted propellers steering.Some propulsion systems inherently steering systems. Examples include outboard motor, bow thruster, Z-drive. Holds, compartments, superstructure Larger boats ships generally multiple decks compartments. Separate berthings heads sailboats 25 feet (7.6 m). Fishing boats cargo ships typically cargo holds. Most larger vessels engine room, galley, compartments work. Tanks store fuel, engine oil, fresh water. Ballast tanks equipped change ship's trim modify stability.Superstructures deck. On sailboats, low. On modern cargo ships, located ship's stern. On passenger ships warships, superstructure generally extends forward. Equipment Shipboard equipment varies ship ship depending factors ship's era, design, area operation, purpose. Some types equipment include:Masts antennas, navigation lights, radar transponders, fog signals, devices required law.Ground tackle includes equipment mooring winches, windlasses, anchors. Anchors moor ships shallow water. They connected ship rope chain. On larger vessels, chain runs hawsepipe.Cargo equipment cranes cargo booms load unload cargo ship's stores.Safety equipment lifeboats, liferafts, survival suits carried aboard vessels emergency use. Design considerations Hydrostatics Ships float water level mass displaced water equals mass vessel, force gravity equals upward force buoyancy. As vessel lowered water weight remains constant corresponding weight water displaced hull increases. If vessel's mass evenly distributed throughout, floats evenly length beam (width). A vessel's stability considered hydrostatic sense well hydrodynamic sense, subjected movement, rolling pitching, action waves wind. Stability problems lead excessive pitching rolling, eventually capsizing sinking. Hydrodynamics The advance vessel water resisted water. This resistance broken components, friction water hull wave making resistance. To reduce resistance increase speed power, reduce wetted surface submerged hull shapes produce amplitude waves. To so, high-speed vessels slender, fewer smaller appendages. The friction water reduced regular maintenance hull remove creatures algae accumulate there. Antifouling paint commonly assist this. Advanced designs bulbous bow assist decreasing wave resistance.A simple considering wave-making resistance hull relation wake. At speeds lower wave propagation speed, wave rapidly dissipates sides. As hull approaches wave propagation speed, however, wake bow build faster dissipate, grows amplitude. Since water "get hull fast enough", hull, essence, climb push bow wave. This exponential increase resistance increasing speed.This hull speed formula: knots ≈ 1.34 × L {\displaystyle {\mbox{knots}}\approx 1.34\times {\sqrt {L{\mbox{ft}}}}} or, metric units: knots ≈ 2.5 × L {\displaystyle {\mbox{knots}}\approx 2.5\times {\sqrt {L{\mbox{m}}}}} L length waterline feet meters.When vessel exceeds speed/length ratio 0.94, starts outrun bow wave, hull settles water supported wave peaks. As vessel exceeds speed/length ratio 1.34, hull speed, wavelength longer hull, stern longer supported wake, causing stern squat, bow rise. The hull starting climb bow wave, resistance increase high rate. While drive displacement hull faster speed/length ratio 1.34, prohibitively expensive so. Most vessels operate speed/length ratios well level, speed/length ratios 1.0.For projects adequate funding, hydrodynamic resistance tested experimentally hull testing pool tools computational fluid dynamics.Vessels subject ocean surface waves swell well effects wind weather. These movements stressful passengers equipment, controlled possible. The rolling movement controlled, extent, ballasting devices fin stabilizers. Pitching movement difficult limit dangerous bow submerges waves, phenomenon called pounding. Sometimes, ships change course speed violent rolling pitching.How convincingly scientific studies 21st century, controllability vessels decreases dramatically cases conditioned effects bifurcation memory. This class vessels includes ships high manoeuvring capabilities, aircraft controlled underwater vehicles designed unstable steady-state motion interesting terms applications. These features considered designing ships control critical situations. Lifecycle A ship pass stages career. The initial contract build ship, details vary based relationships shipowners, operators, designers shipyard. Then, design phase carried naval architect. Then ship constructed shipyard. After construction, vessel launched service. Ships careers number ways, ranging shipwrecks service museum ship scrapyard. Design A vessel's design starts specification, naval architect create project outline, assess required dimensions, create basic layout spaces displacement. After initial draft, architect create initial hull design, general profile initial overview ship's propulsion. At stage, designer iterate ship's design, adding detail refining design stage.The designer typically produce plan, general specification describing peculiarities vessel, construction blueprints building site. Designs larger complex vessels include sail plans, electrical schematics, plumbing ventilation plans.As environmental laws strict, ship designers create design ship, nears end-of-term, disassembled disposed easily waste reduced minimum. Construction Ship construction takes shipyard, months unit produced series, years reconstruct wooden boat frigate Hermione, 10 years aircraft carrier. During World War II, cargo ships urgent construction Liberty Ships initially months longer, weeks days. Builders employed production prefabrication techniques shipyards today.Hull materials vessel size play determining method construction. The hull mass-produced fiberglass sailboat constructed mold, steel hull cargo ship sections welded built.Generally, construction starts hull, vessels 30 meters (98 ft), laying keel. This drydock land. Once hull assembled painted, launched. The stages, raising superstructure adding equipment accommodation, vessel afloat.Once completed, vessel delivered customer. Ship launching ceremony significance, vessel formally named. A typical small rowboat cost US$100, $1,000 small speedboat, tens thousands dollars cruising sailboat, $2,000,000 Vendée Globe class sailboat. A 25 meters (82 ft) trawler cost $2.5 million, 1,000-person-capacity high-speed passenger ferry cost neighborhood $50 million. A ship's cost partly depends complexity: small, general cargo ship cost $20 million, Panamax-sized bulk carrier $35 million, supertanker $105 LNG carrier $200 million. The expensive ships generally cost embedded electronics: Seawolf-class submarine costs $2 billion, aircraft carrier $3.5 billion. Repair conversion Ships undergo constant maintenance career, underway, pierside, cases, periods reduced operating status charters shipping seasons.Most ships, however, require trips facilities drydock regular intervals. Tasks drydock include removing biological growths hull, sandblasting repainting hull, replacing sacrificial anodes protect submerged equipment corrosion. Major repairs propulsion steering systems well major electrical systems performed dry dock.Vessels sustain major damage repaired facility equipped major repairs, shipyard. Ships converted purpose: oil tankers converted floating production storage offloading units. End service Most ocean-going cargo ships life expectancy 20 30 years. A sailboat plywood fiberglass 30 40 years. Solid wooden ships longer require regular maintenance. Carefully maintained steel-hulled yachts lifespan 100 years.As ships age, forces corrosion, osmosis, rotting compromise hull strength, vessel dangerous sail. At point, scuttled scrapped shipbreakers. Ships museum ships, expended construct breakwaters artificial reefs.Many ships scrapyard, lost fires, collisions, grounding, sinking sea. The Allies lost 5,150 ships World War II. Measuring ships One measure ships terms length, length ship waterline, beam (breadth), depth (distance crown weather deck keelson), draft (distance highest waterline bottom ship) tonnage. A number tonnage definitions exist describing merchant ships purpose tolls, taxation, etc.In Britain Samuel Plimsoll's Merchant Shipping Act 1876, ship-owners load vessels decks awash, dangerously unstable condition. Anyone signed ship voyage and, realizing danger, chose leave ship, jail. Plimsoll, Member Parliament, realised problem engaged engineers derive fairly simple formula determine position ship's hull which, reached surface water loading cargo, ship reached maximum safe loading level. To day, mark, called "Plimsoll Line", exists ships' sides, consists circle horizontal centre. On Great Lakes North America circle replaced diamond. Because types water (summer, fresh, tropical fresh, winter north Atlantic) densities, subsequent regulations required painting group lines forward Plimsoll mark indicate safe depth (or freeboard surface) ship load water densities. Hence "ladder" lines forward Plimsoll mark day. This called "freeboard mark" "load mark" marine industry. Ship pollution Ship pollution pollution air water shipping. It problem accelerating trade increasingly globalized, posing increasing threat world’s oceans waterways globalization continues. It expected that, “...shipping traffic United States projected double 2020." Because increased traffic ocean ports, pollution ships directly coastal areas. The pollution produced biodiversity, climate, food, human health. However, degree humans polluting highly debated hot international topic 30 years. Oil spills Oil spills devastating effects environment. Crude oil polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) difficult clean up, years sediment marine environment. Marine species constantly exposed PAHs exhibit developmental problems, susceptibility disease, abnormal reproductive cycles.By sheer amount oil carried, modern oil tankers considered threat environment. An oil tanker carry 2 barrels (318,000 m3) crude oil, 84,000,000 US gallons (69,940,000 gal; 318,000,000 L). This amount spilled Exxon Valdez incident. In spill, ship aground dumped 10,800,000 US gallons (8,993,000 gal; 40,880,000 L) oil ocean March 1989. Despite efforts scientists, managers, volunteers, 400,000 seabirds, 1,000 otters, immense numbers fish killed.The International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation researched 9,351 accidental spills 1974. According study, spills routine operations loading cargo, discharging cargo, fuel oil. 91% operational oil spills small, 7 tons spill. Spills accidents collisions, groundings, hull failures, explosions larger, 84% involving losses 700 tons.Following Exxon Valdez spill, United States passed Oil Pollution Act 1990 (OPA-90), included stipulation tankers entering waters double-hulled 2015. Following sinkings Erika (1999) Prestige (2002), European Union passed stringent anti-pollution packages (known Erika I, II, III), require tankers entering waters double-hulled 2010. The Erika packages controversial introduced legal concept "serious negligence". Ballast water When vessel container ship oil tanker unloads cargo, seawater pumped compartments hull help stabilize balance ship. During loading, ballast water pumped compartments.One problems ballast water transfer transport harmful organisms. Meinesz believes worst cases single invasive species causing harm ecosystem attributed seemingly harmless jellyfish. Mnemiopsis leidyi, species comb jellyfish inhabits estuaries United States Valdés peninsula Argentina Atlantic coast, caused notable damage Black Sea. It introduced 1982, thought transported Black Sea ship’s ballast water. The population jellyfish shot exponentially and, 1988, wreaking havoc local fishing industry. "The anchovy catch fell 204,000 tonnes (225,000 short tons; 201,000 tons) 1984 200 tonnes (220 short tons; 197 tons) 1993; sprat 24,600 tonnes (27,100 short tons; 24,200 tons) 1984 12,000 tonnes (13,200 short tons; 11,800 tons) 1993; horse mackerel 4,000 tonnes (4,410 short tons; 3,940 tons) 1984 1993." Now jellyfish exhausted zooplankton, including fish larvae, numbers fallen dramatically, continue maintain stranglehold ecosystem. Recently jellyfish discovered Caspian Sea. Invasive species occupied areas, facilitate spread diseases, introduce genetic material, alter landscapes jeopardize ability native species food. "On land sea, invasive species responsible 137 billion dollars lost revenue management costs U.S. year."Ballast bilge discharge ships spread human pathogens harmful diseases toxins causing health issues humans marine life alike. Discharges coastal waters, sources marine pollution, toxic marine plants, animals, microorganisms, causing alterations changes growth, disruption hormone cycles, birth defects, suppression immune system, disorders cancer, tumors, genetic abnormalities death. Exhaust emissions Exhaust emissions ships considered source air pollution. “Seagoing vessels responsible estimated 14 percent emissions nitrogen fossil fuels 16 percent emissions sulfur petroleum atmosphere.” In Europe ships percentage sulfur introduced air, “...as sulfur cars, lorries factories Europe together.” “By 2010, 40% air pollution land ships.” Sulfur air creates acid rain damages crops buildings. When inhaled sulfur respiratory problems increase risk heart attack. Ship breaking Ship breaking ship demolition type ship disposal involving breaking ships scrap recycling, hulls discarded ship graveyards. Most ships lifespan decades wear refitting repair uneconomical. Ship breaking allows materials ship, steel, reused.In addition steel materials, however, ships (particularly older vessels) substances banned considered dangerous developed countries. Asbestos polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) typical examples. Asbestos heavily ship construction finally banned developed mid 1980s. Currently, costs associated removing asbestos, expensive insurance health risks, ship-breaking developed countries longer economically viable. Removing metal scrap cost scrap metal itself. In developing world, however, shipyards operate risk personal injury lawsuits workers' health claims, meaning shipyards operate high health risks. Furthermore, workers paid rates overtime allowances. Protective equipment absent inadequate. Dangerous vapors fumes burning materials inhaled, dusty asbestos-laden areas breakdown locations commonplace.Aside health yard workers, years, ship breaking issue major environmental concern. Many developing nations, ship breaking yards located, lax environmental law, enabling quantities highly toxic materials escape environment causing serious health problems ship breakers, local population wildlife. Environmental campaign groups Greenpeace issue high priority campaigns.

A computer device instructed carry arbitrary set arithmetic logical operations automatically. The ability computers sequence operations, called program, computers applicable range tasks. Such computers control systems variety industrial consumer devices. This includes simple purpose devices microwave ovens remote controls, factory devices industrial robots computer assisted design, general purpose devices personal computers mobile devices smartphones. The Internet computers connects millions computers.Since ancient times, simple manual devices abacus aided people calculations. Early Industrial Revolution, mechanical devices built automate tedious tasks, guiding patterns looms. More sophisticated electrical machines specialized analog calculations 20th century. The digital electronic calculating machines developed World War II. The speed, power, versatility computers increased continuously dramatically then.Conventionally, modern computer consists processing element, typically central processing unit (CPU), memory. The processing element carries arithmetic logical operations, sequencing control unit change order operations response stored information. Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), input/output devices perform functions (e.g., 2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral devices allow retrieved external source enable operations saved retrieved. Etymology According Oxford English Dictionary, "computer" 1613 book called The Yong Mans Gleanings English writer Richard Braithwait: "I haue [sic] truest computer Times, best Arithmetician euer [sic] breathed, reduceth thy dayes short number." This usage term referred person carried calculations computations. The continued meaning middle 20th century. From 19th century began familiar meaning, machine carries computations.The Online Etymology Dictionary attested "computer" "1640s, [meaning] "one calculates,"; "... agent compute (v.)". The Online Etymology Dictionary term "calculating machine" (of type) 1897." The Online Etymology Dictionary indicates "modern use" term, "programmable digital electronic computer" dates "... 1945 name; [in a] theoretical [sense] 1937, Turing machine". History Pre-20th century Devices computation thousands years, one-to-one correspondence fingers. The earliest counting device tally stick. Later record keeping aids Fertile Crescent included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) represented counts items, livestock grains, sealed hollow unbaked clay containers. The counting rods example.The abacus initially arithmetic tasks. The Roman abacus developed devices Babylonia 2400 BC. Since then, forms reckoning boards tables invented. In medieval European counting house, checkered cloth table, markers moved rules, calculating sums money.The Antikythera mechanism believed earliest mechanical analog "computer", Derek J. Solla Price. It designed calculate astronomical positions. It discovered 1901 Antikythera wreck Greek island Antikythera, Kythera Crete, dated circa 100 BC. Devices level complexity comparable Antikythera mechanism reappear years later.Many mechanical aids calculation measurement constructed astronomical navigation use. The planisphere star chart invented Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī 11th century. The astrolabe invented Hellenistic 1st 2nd centuries BC attributed Hipparchus. A combination planisphere dioptra, astrolabe effectively analog computer capable working kinds problems spherical astronomy. An astrolabe incorporating mechanical calendar computer gear-wheels invented Abi Bakr Isfahan, Persia 1235. Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī invented mechanical geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe, fixed-wired knowledge processing machine gear train gear-wheels, circa 1000 AD.The sector, calculating instrument solving problems proportion, trigonometry, multiplication division, functions, squares cube roots, developed 16th century application gunnery, surveying navigation.The planimeter manual instrument calculate area closed figure tracing mechanical linkage.The slide rule invented 1620–1630, shortly publication concept logarithm. It hand-operated analog computer multiplication division. As slide rule development progressed, scales provided reciprocals, squares square roots, cubes cube roots, well transcendental functions logarithms exponentials, circular hyperbolic trigonometry functions. Aviation fields slide rules widespread use, solving time–distance problems aircraft. To save space reading, typically circular devices classic linear slide rule shape. A popular example E6B.In 1770s Pierre Jaquet-Droz, Swiss watchmaker, built mechanical doll (automata) write holding quill pen. By switching number order internal wheels letters, messages, produced. In effect, mechanically "programmed" instructions. Along complex machines, doll Musée d'Art d'Histoire Neuchâtel, Switzerland, operates.The tide-predicting machine invented Sir William Thomson 1872 great utility navigation shallow waters. It system pulleys wires automatically calculate predicted tide levels set period location.The differential analyser, mechanical analog computer designed solve differential equations integration, wheel-and-disc mechanisms perform integration. In 1876 Lord Kelvin discussed construction calculators, stymied limited output torque ball-and-disk integrators. In differential analyzer, output integrator drove input integrator, graphing output. The torque amplifier advance allowed machines work. Starting 1920s, Vannevar Bush developed mechanical differential analyzers. First computing device Charles Babbage, English mechanical engineer polymath, originated concept programmable computer. Considered "father computer", conceptualized invented mechanical computer 19th century. After working revolutionary difference engine, designed navigational calculations, 1833 realized general design, Analytical Engine, possible. The input programs data provided machine punched cards, method direct mechanical looms Jacquard loom. For output, machine printer, curve plotter bell. The machine punch numbers cards later. The Engine incorporated arithmetic logic unit, control flow conditional branching loops, integrated memory, making design general-purpose computer described modern terms Turing-complete.The machine century ahead time. All parts machine — major problem device thousands parts. Eventually, project dissolved decision British Government cease funding. Babbage's failure complete analytical engine chiefly attributed difficulties politics financing, desire develop increasingly sophisticated computer move ahead faster follow. Nevertheless, son, Henry Babbage, completed simplified version analytical engine's computing unit (the mill) 1888. He demonstration computing tables 1906. Analog computers During half 20th century, scientific computing increasingly sophisticated analog computers, direct mechanical electrical model problem basis computation. However, programmable generally lacked versatility accuracy modern digital computers. The modern analog computer tide-predicting machine, invented Sir William Thomson 1872. The differential analyser, mechanical analog computer designed solve differential equations integration wheel-and-disc mechanisms, conceptualized 1876 James Thomson, brother famous Lord Kelvin.The mechanical analog computing reached zenith differential analyzer, built H. L. Hazen Vannevar Bush MIT starting 1927. This built mechanical integrators James Thomson torque amplifiers invented H. W. Nieman. A dozen devices built obsolescence obvious. By 1950s digital electronic computers spelled analog computing machines, analog computers remained 1950s specialized applications education (control systems) aircraft (slide rule). Digital computers Electromechanical By 1938 United States Navy developed electromechanical analog computer small aboard submarine. This Torpedo Data Computer, trigonometry solve problem firing torpedo moving target. During World War II devices developed countries well.Early digital computers electromechanical; electric switches drove mechanical relays perform calculation. These devices operating speed eventually superseded faster all-electric computers, originally vacuum tubes. The Z2, created German engineer Konrad Zuse 1939, earliest examples electromechanical relay computer.In 1941, Zuse earlier machine Z3, world's working electromechanical programmable, automatic digital computer. The Z3 built 2000 relays, implementing 22 bit length operated clock frequency 5–10 Hz. Program code supplied punched film data stored 64 memory supplied keyboard. It modern machines respects, pioneering numerous advances floating point numbers. Rather harder-to-implement decimal system (used Charles Babbage's earlier design), binary system Zuse's machines easier build reliable, technologies time. The Z3 Turing complete. Vacuum tubes digital electronic circuits Purely electronic circuit elements replaced mechanical electromechanical equivalents, digital calculation replaced analog. The engineer Tommy Flowers, working Post Office Research Station London 1930s, began explore electronics telephone exchange. Experimental equipment built 1934 operation years later, converting portion telephone exchange network electronic data processing system, thousands vacuum tubes. In US, John Vincent Atanasoff Clifford E. Berry Iowa State University developed tested Atanasoff–Berry Computer (ABC) 1942, "automatic electronic digital computer". This design all-electronic 300 vacuum tubes, capacitors fixed mechanically rotating drum memory.During World War II, British Bletchley Park achieved number successes breaking encrypted German military communications. The German encryption machine, Enigma, attacked help electro-mechanical bombes. To crack sophisticated German Lorenz SZ 40/42 machine, high-level Army communications, Max Newman colleagues commissioned Flowers build Colossus. He spent eleven months February 1943 designing building Colossus. After functional test December 1943, Colossus shipped Bletchley Park, delivered 18 January 1944 attacked message 5 February.Colossus world's electronic digital programmable computer. It number valves (vacuum tubes). It paper-tape input capable configured perform variety boolean logical operations data, Turing-complete. Nine Mk II Colossi built (The Mk I converted Mk II making machines total). Colossus Mark I contained 1500 thermionic valves (tubes), Mark II 2400 valves, 5 faster simpler operate Mark 1, greatly speeding decoding process.The U.S.-built ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator Computer) electronic programmable computer built US. Although ENIAC Colossus, faster, flexible, Turing-complete. Like Colossus, "program" ENIAC defined patch cables switches, cry stored program electronic machines later. Once program written, mechanically set machine manual resetting plugs switches.It combined high speed electronics ability programmed complex problems. It subtract 5000 second, faster machine. It modules multiply, divide, square root. High speed memory limited 20 (about 80 bytes). Built direction John Mauchly J. Presper Eckert University Pennsylvania, ENIAC's development construction lasted 1943 operation 1945. The machine huge, weighing 30 tons, 200 kilowatts electric power contained 18,000 vacuum tubes, 1,500 relays, hundreds thousands resistors, capacitors, inductors. Modern computers Concept modern computer The principle modern computer proposed Alan Turing seminal 1936 paper, On Computable Numbers. Turing proposed simple device called "Universal Computing machine" universal Turing machine. He proved machine capable computing computable executing instructions (program) stored tape, allowing machine programmable. The fundamental concept Turing's design stored program, instructions computing stored memory. Von Neumann acknowledged central concept modern computer paper. Turing machines day central object study theory computation. Except limitations imposed finite memory stores, modern computers Turing-complete, say, algorithm execution capability equivalent universal Turing machine. Stored programs Early computing machines fixed programs. Changing function required re-wiring re-structuring machine. With proposal stored-program computer changed. A stored-program computer includes design instruction set store memory set instructions (a program) details computation. The theoretical basis stored-program computer laid Alan Turing 1936 paper. In 1945 Turing joined National Physical Laboratory began work developing electronic stored-program digital computer. His 1945 report "Proposed Electronic Calculator" specification device. John von Neumann University Pennsylvania circulated First Draft Report EDVAC 1945.The Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine, nicknamed Baby, world's stored-program computer. It built Victoria University Manchester Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn Geoff Tootill, program 21 June 1948. It designed testbed Williams tube, random-access digital storage device. Although computer considered "small primitive" standards time, working machine elements essential modern electronic computer. As SSEM demonstrated feasibility design, project initiated university develop usable computer, Manchester Mark 1.The Mark 1 turn prototype Ferranti Mark 1, world's commercially general-purpose computer. Built Ferranti, delivered University Manchester February 1951. At machines delivered 1953 1957, Shell labs Amsterdam. In October 1947, directors British catering company J. Lyons & Company decided active role promoting commercial development computers. The LEO I computer operational April 1951 world's regular routine office computer job. Transistors The bipolar transistor invented 1947. From 1955 onwards transistors replaced vacuum tubes computer designs, "second generation" computers. Compared vacuum tubes, transistors advantages: smaller, require power vacuum tubes, heat. Silicon junction transistors reliable vacuum tubes longer, indefinite, service life. Transistorized computers tens thousands binary logic circuits compact space.At University Manchester, team leadership Tom Kilburn designed built machine newly developed transistors valves. Their transistorised computer world, operational 1953, second version completed April 1955. However, machine valves generate 125 kHz clock waveforms circuitry write magnetic drum memory, completely transistorized computer. That distinction Harwell CADET 1955, built electronics division Atomic Energy Research Establishment Harwell. Integrated circuits The great advance computing power advent integrated circuit. The idea integrated circuit conceived radar scientist working Royal Radar Establishment Ministry Defence, Geoffrey W.A. Dummer. Dummer presented public description integrated circuit Symposium Progress Quality Electronic Components Washington, D.C. 7 May 1952.The practical ICs invented Jack Kilby Texas Instruments Robert Noyce Fairchild Semiconductor. Kilby recorded initial ideas concerning integrated circuit July 1958, demonstrating working integrated example 12 September 1958. In patent application 6 February 1959, Kilby described device "a semiconductor material ... components electronic circuit completely integrated". Noyce idea integrated circuit half year Kilby. His chip solved practical problems Kilby's not. Produced Fairchild Semiconductor, silicon, Kilby's chip germanium.This development heralded explosion commercial personal computers led microprocessor. While subject exactly device microprocessor contentious, partly lack agreement exact definition term "microprocessor", undisputed single-chip microprocessor Intel 4004, designed realized Ted Hoff, Federico Faggin, Stanley Mazor Intel. Mobile computers With continued miniaturization computing resources, advancements portable battery life, portable computers grew popularity 2000s. The developments spurred growth laptop computers portable computers allowed manufacturers integrate computing resources cellular phones. These so-called smartphones tablets variety operating systems computing device market, manufacturers reporting shipped estimated 237 devices 2Q 2013. Types Computers typically classified based uses: Based Analog computerDigital computerHybrid computer Based sizes SmartphoneMicro computerPersonal computerLaptopMini ComputerMainframe computerSuper computer Hardware The term hardware covers parts computer tangible physical objects. Circuits, computer chips, graphic cards, sound cards, memory (RAM), motherboard, displays, power supplies, cables, keyboards, printers "mice" input devices hardware. History computing hardware Other hardware topics A general purpose computer components: arithmetic logic unit (ALU), control unit, memory, input output devices (collectively termed I/O). These parts interconnected buses, groups wires. Inside parts thousands trillions small electrical circuits turned electronic switch. Each circuit represents bit (binary digit) circuit represents "1", represents "0" (in positive logic representation). The circuits arranged logic gates circuits control circuits. Input devices When unprocessed data computer help input devices, data processed output devices. The input devices hand-operated automated. The processing regulated CPU. Some examples hand-operated input devices are:Computer keyboardDigital cameraDigital videoGraphics tabletImage scannerJoystickMicrophoneMouseOverlay keyboardTrackballTouchscreen Output devices The computer output output devices. Some examples output devices are:Computer monitorPrinterPC speakerProjectorSound cardVideo card Control unit The control unit (often called control system central controller) manages computer's components; reads interprets (decodes) program instructions, transforming control signals activate parts computer. Control systems advanced computers change order execution instructions improve performance.A component common CPUs program counter, memory cell (a register) track location memory instruction from.The control system's function follows—note simplified description, steps performed concurrently order depending type CPU:Read code instruction cell indicated program counter.Decode numerical code instruction set commands signals systems.Increment program counter points instruction.Read data instruction requires cells memory (or input device). The location required data typically stored instruction code.Provide data ALU register.If instruction requires ALU specialized hardware complete, instruct hardware perform requested operation.Write ALU memory location register output device.Jump step (1).Since program counter (conceptually) set memory cells, changed calculations ALU. Adding 100 program counter instruction 100 locations program. Instructions modify program counter "jumps" allow loops (instructions repeated computer) conditional instruction execution (both examples control flow).The sequence operations control unit process instruction short computer program, indeed, complex CPU designs, smaller computer called microsequencer, runs microcode program events happen. Central processing unit (CPU) The control unit, ALU, registers collectively central processing unit (CPU). Early CPUs composed separate components mid-1970s CPUs typically constructed single integrated circuit called microprocessor. Arithmetic logic unit (ALU) The ALU capable performing classes operations: arithmetic logic. The set arithmetic operations ALU supports limited addition subtraction, include multiplication, division, trigonometry functions sine, cosine, etc., square roots. Some operate numbers (integers) whilst floating point represent numbers, albeit limited precision. However, computer capable performing simplest operations programmed break complex operations simple steps perform. Therefore, computer programmed perform arithmetic operation—although ALU directly support operation. An ALU compare numbers return boolean truth values (true false) depending equal to, greater ("is 64 greater 65?"). Logic operations involve Boolean logic: AND, OR, XOR, NOT. These creating complicated conditional statements processing boolean logic.Superscalar computers multiple ALUs, allowing process instructions simultaneously. Graphics processors computers SIMD MIMD features ALUs perform arithmetic vectors matrices. Memory A computer's memory viewed list cells numbers read. Each cell numbered "address" store single number. The computer instructed "put number 123 cell numbered 1357" "add number cell 1357 number cell 2468 answer cell 1595." The stored memory represent practically anything. Letters, numbers, computer instructions memory equal ease. Since CPU differentiate types information, software's responsibility significance memory sees series numbers.In modern computers, memory cell set store binary numbers groups bits (called byte). Each byte represent 256 numbers (28 256); 0 255 −128 +127. To store larger numbers, consecutive bytes (typically, two, eight). When negative numbers required, stored two's complement notation. Other arrangements possible, specialized applications historical contexts. A computer store kind memory represented numerically. Modern computers billions trillions bytes memory.The CPU set memory cells called registers written rapidly memory area. There typically registers depending type CPU. Registers frequently needed data items avoid access memory data needed. As data constantly worked on, reducing access memory (which slow compared ALU control units) greatly increases computer's speed.Computer memory principal varieties:random-access memory RAMread-only memory ROMRAM written anytime CPU commands it, ROM preloaded data software changes, CPU it. ROM typically store computer's initial start-up instructions. In general, contents RAM erased power computer turned off, ROM retains data indefinitely. In PC, ROM specialized program called BIOS orchestrates loading computer's operating system disk drive RAM computer turned reset. In embedded computers, frequently disk drives, required software stored ROM. Software stored ROM called firmware, notionally hardware software. Flash memory blurs distinction ROM RAM, retains data turned rewritable. It typically slower conventional ROM RAM however, restricted applications high speed unnecessary.In sophisticated computers RAM cache memories, slower registers faster memory. Generally computers sort cache designed move frequently needed data cache automatically, intervention programmer's part. Input/output (I/O) I/O computer exchanges world. Devices input output computer called peripherals. On typical personal computer, peripherals include input devices keyboard mouse, output devices display printer. Hard disk drives, floppy disk drives optical disc drives serve input output devices. Computer networking I/O. I/O devices complex computers right, CPU memory. A graphics processing unit fifty tiny computers perform calculations display 3D graphics. Modern desktop computers smaller computers assist CPU performing I/O. A 2016-era flat screen display computer circuitry. Multitasking While computer viewed running gigantic program stored memory, systems appearance running programs simultaneously. This achieved multitasking i.e. computer switch rapidly running program turn. One signal called interrupt, periodically computer executing instructions instead. By remembering executing prior interrupt, computer return task later. If programs running "at time". interrupt generator causing interrupts second, causing program switch time. Since modern computers typically execute instructions orders magnitude faster human perception, appear programs running executing instant. This method multitasking termed "time-sharing" program allocated "slice" turn.Before inexpensive computers, principal multitasking allow people share computer. Seemingly, multitasking computer switching programs slowly, direct proportion number programs running, programs spend waiting slow input/output devices complete tasks. If program waiting user click mouse press keyboard, "time slice" event waiting occurred. This frees programs execute programs simultaneously unacceptable speed loss. Multiprocessing Some computers designed distribute work CPUs multiprocessing configuration, technique employed powerful machines supercomputers, mainframe computers servers. Multiprocessor multi-core (multiple CPUs single integrated circuit) personal laptop computers available, increasingly lower-end markets result.Supercomputers highly unique architectures basic stored-program architecture general purpose computers. They feature thousands CPUs, customized high-speed interconnects, specialized computing hardware. Such designs specialized tasks scale program organization required utilize resources once. Supercomputers usage large-scale simulation, graphics rendering, cryptography applications, well so-called "embarrassingly parallel" tasks. Software Software refers parts computer material form, programs, data, protocols, etc. Software computer system consists encoded computer instructions, contrast physical hardware system built. Computer software includes computer programs, libraries non-executable data, online documentation digital media. Computer hardware software require realistically own. When software stored hardware easily modified, BIOS ROM IBM PC compatible) computer, called "firmware". Operating systems Languages There thousands programming languages—some intended general purpose, highly specialized applications. Application Software Programs The defining feature modern computers distinguishes machines programmed. That type instructions (the program) computer, process them. Modern computers based von Neumann architecture machine code imperative programming language. In practical terms, computer program instructions extend millions instructions, programs processors web browsers example. A typical modern computer execute billions instructions second (gigaflops) rarely mistake years operation. Large computer programs consisting instructions teams programmers years write, complexity task errors. Stored program architecture This applies common RAM machine-based computers.In cases, computer instructions simple: number another, move data location another, send message external device, etc. These instructions computer's memory generally carried (executed) order given. However, specialized instructions computer jump ahead backwards program carry executing there. These called "jump" instructions (or branches). Furthermore, jump instructions conditionally sequences instructions depending calculation external event. Many computers directly support subroutines providing type jump "remembers" location jumped instruction return instruction jump instruction.Program execution likened reading book. While person sequence, jump earlier text skip sections interest. Similarly, computer repeat instructions program internal condition met. This called flow control program allows computer perform tasks repeatedly human intervention.Comparatively, person pocket calculator perform basic arithmetic operation adding numbers button presses. But numbers 1 1,000 thousands button presses lot time, certainty making mistake. On hand, computer programmed simple instructions. The example written MIPS assembly language:Once told program, computer perform repetitive addition task human intervention. It mistake modern PC complete task fraction second. Machine code In computers, individual instructions stored machine code instruction unique number (its operation code opcode short). The command numbers opcode; command multiply opcode, on. The simplest computers perform handful instructions; complex computers choose from, unique numerical code. Since computer's memory store numbers, store instruction codes. This leads fact entire programs (which lists instructions) represented lists numbers manipulated inside computer numeric data. The fundamental concept storing programs computer's memory alongside data operate crux von Neumann, stored program, architecture. In cases, computer store program memory separate data operates on. This called Harvard architecture Harvard Mark I computer. Modern von Neumann computers display traits Harvard architecture designs, CPU caches.While write computer programs lists numbers (machine language) technique computers, extremely tedious error-prone practice, complicated programs. Instead, basic instruction short indicative function easy remember – mnemonic ADD, SUB, MULT JUMP. These mnemonics collectively computer's assembly language. Converting programs written assembly language computer understand (machine language) computer program called assembler. Programming language Programming languages programs computers run. Unlike natural languages, programming languages designed permit ambiguity concise. They purely written languages difficult aloud. They generally translated machine code compiler assembler run, translated directly interpreter. Sometimes programs executed hybrid method techniques. Low-level languages Machine languages assembly languages represent (collectively termed low-level programming languages) unique type computer. For instance, ARM architecture computer (such smartphone hand-held videogame) understand machine language x86 CPU PC. High-level languages/third generation language Though considerably easier machine language, writing programs assembly language difficult error prone. Therefore, practical programs written abstract high-level programming languages express programmer conveniently (and help reduce programmer error). High level languages "compiled" machine language (or assembly language machine language) computer program called compiler. High level languages workings target computer assembly language, language structure problem(s) solved final program. It compilers translate high level language program machine language types computer. This software video games computer architectures personal computers video game consoles. Fourth generation languages These 4G languages procedural 3G languages. The benefit 4GL requiring direct help programmer. An example 4GL SQL. Program design Program design small programs simple involves analysis problem, collection inputs, programming constructs languages, devising established procedures algorithms, providing data output devices solutions problem applicable. As problems larger complex, features subprograms, modules, formal documentation, paradigms object-oriented programming encountered. Large programs involving thousands code require formal software methodologies. The task developing software systems presents intellectual challenge. Producing software acceptably high reliability predictable schedule budget historically difficult; academic professional discipline software engineering concentrates challenge. Bugs Errors computer programs called "bugs". They benign program, subtle effects. But cases, program entire system "hang", unresponsive input mouse clicks keystrokes, completely fail, crash. Otherwise benign bugs harnessed malicious intent unscrupulous user writing exploit, code designed advantage bug disrupt computer's proper execution. Bugs fault computer. Since computers execute instructions given, bugs programmer error oversight program's design. Admiral Grace Hopper, American computer scientist developer compiler, credited term "bugs" computing dead moth shorting relay Harvard Mark II computer September 1947. Firmware Firmware technology combination hardware software BIOS chip inside computer. This chip (hardware) located motherboard BIOS set (software) stored it. Networking Internet Computers coordinate multiple locations 1950s. The U.S. military's SAGE system large-scale example system, led number special-purpose commercial systems Sabre. In 1970s, computer engineers institutions United States began link computers telecommunications technology. The effort funded ARPA (now DARPA), computer network called ARPANET. The technologies Arpanet spread evolved.In time, network spread academic military institutions Internet. The emergence networking involved redefinition nature boundaries computer. Computer operating systems applications modified include ability define access resources computers network, peripheral devices, stored information, like, extensions resources individual computer. Initially facilities people working high-tech environments, 1990s spread applications e-mail World Wide Web, combined development cheap, fast networking technologies Ethernet ADSL computer networking ubiquitous. In fact, number computers networked growing phenomenally. A proportion personal computers regularly connect Internet communicate receive information. "Wireless" networking, utilizing mobile phone networks, networking increasingly ubiquitous mobile computing environments. Misconceptions Human computer A computer electronic, processor, RAM, disk. While popular usage "computer" synonymous personal electronic computer, modern definition computer literally: "A device computes, programmable [usually] electronic machine performs high-speed mathematical logical operations assembles, stores, correlates, processes information." Any device processes qualifies computer, processing purposeful. Unconventional computing Historically, computers evolved mechanical computers eventually vacuum tubes transistors. However, conceptually computational systems flexible personal computer built anything. For example, computer billiard balls (billiard ball computer); quoted example. More realistically, modern computers transistors photolithographed semiconductors. Future There active computers promising types technology, optical computers, DNA computers, neural computers, quantum computers. Most computers universal, calculate computable function, limited memory capacity operating speed. However designs computers performance problems; example quantum computers break modern encryption algorithms (by quantum factoring) quickly. Computer architecture paradigms There types computer architectures:Quantum computer vs. Chemical computerScalar processor vs. Vector processorNon-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) computersRegister machine vs. Stack machineHarvard architecture vs. von Neumann architectureCellular architectureOf abstract machines, quantum computer holds promise revolutionizing computing. Logic gates common abstraction apply digital analog paradigms. The ability store execute lists instructions called programs computers extremely versatile, distinguishing calculators. The Church–Turing thesis mathematical statement versatility: computer minimum capability (being Turing-complete) is, principle, capable performing tasks computer perform. Therefore, type computer (netbook, supercomputer, cellular automaton, etc.) perform computational tasks, storage capacity. Artificial intelligence A computer solve problems exactly programmed to, efficiency, alternative solutions, shortcuts, errors code. Computer programs learn adapt emerging field artificial intelligence machine learning.

Cricket bat-and-ball game played teams eleven players cricket field, centre rectangular 22-yard-long pitch wicket (a set three wooden stumps) end. One team bats, attempting score runs possible, whilst opponents field. Each phase play called innings. After batsmen dismissed fixed number overs completed, teams swap roles. The winning team scores runs, including extras gained, innings.At start game, batsmen eleven fielders enter field play. The play member fielding team, bowler, delivers ball pitch other, wicket end, front stands batsmen, striker. The striker "takes guard" crease drawn pitch feet front wicket. His role prevent ball hitting stumps bat, simultaneously strike well score runs. The batsman, non-striker, waits opposite pitch bowler. A dismissed batsman leave field, teammate replaces him. The bowler's objectives prevent scoring runs dismiss batsman. An set deliveries bowled bowler. The bowled pitch bowler.The common forms dismissal bowled, bowler hits stumps directly ball, leg wicket, batsman prevents ball hitting stumps bat, caught, batsman hits ball air intercepted fielder touching ground. Runs scored methods: hitting ball boundary, batsmen swapping simultaneously running length pitch opposite directions whilst fielders retrieving ball. If fielder retrieves ball wicket batsman reached crease pitch, batsman dismissed (a run-out occurs). Adjudication performed field umpires.The laws cricket maintained International Cricket Council (ICC) Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). There formats ranging Twenty20, played hours team single 20 overs (i.e. 120 deliveries), Test cricket, played days unlimited overs teams playing apiece. Traditionally cricketers play all-white kit, limited overs cricket wear club team colours. In addition basic kit, players wear protective gear prevent injury caused ball, hard, solid object compressed leather enclosing cork core.Although cricket's origins uncertain, recorded south-east England 16th century. It spread globally expansion British Empire, leading international matches mid-19th century. ICC, game's governing body, 100 members, members play Test cricket. The sport Australasia, Britain, Indian subcontinent, southern Africa West Indies. Women's cricket, organised played separately, achieved international standard. Etymology A number suggested sources term "cricket". In earliest definite reference sport 1598 called creckett. One source Old English cricc cryce meaning crutch staff. In Samuel Johnson's Dictionary, derived cricket "cryce, Saxon, stick". In Old French, criquet kind club stick.Given medieval trade connections south-east England County Flanders belonged Duchy Burgundy, derived Middle Dutch (in Flanders time) krick(-e), meaning stick (crook). Another source Middle Dutch krickstoel, meaning stool kneeling church resembled wicket stumps cricket. According Heiner Gillmeister, European language expert Bonn University, "cricket" derives Middle Dutch phrase hockey, (krik ket)sen (i.e., "with stick chase"). Dr Gillmeister believes sport Flemish origin. History Cricket definitely traced Tudor 16th-century England number claims, spurious and/or lacking evidence, supporting earlier dates 1301. The earliest definite reference cricket played evidence 1598 court case mentions "creckett" (sic) played common land Guildford 1550. The court Guildford heard Monday, 17 January 1597 (Julian date, equating year 1598 Gregorian calendar) 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, witness scholar "Free School Guildford", fifty years earlier, "hee diverse fellows runne play [on common land] creckett plaies."It believed cricket originally children's game references 1611 indicate adults started playing earliest organised inter-parish village cricket match played time. In 1624, player called Jasper Vinall died struck head match parish teams Sussex. During 17th century, numerous references indicate growth cricket south-east England. By century, organised activity played high stakes believed professionals appeared years Restoration 1660. A newspaper report survives "a great cricket match" eleven players played high stakes Sussex 1697, earliest reference cricket match importance.The game underwent major development 18th century. Betting played development rich patrons forming "select XIs". Cricket prominent London 1707 and, middle years century, crowds flocked matches Artillery Ground Finsbury. The single wicket sport attracted huge crowds wagers match, popularity peaking 1748 season. Bowling underwent evolution 1760 bowlers began pitch ball rolling skimming batsman. This caused revolution bat design because, deal bouncing ball, introduce modern straight bat "hockey stick" shape. The Hambledon Club founded 1760s and, twenty years Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) opening Lord's Old Ground 1787, Hambledon game's greatest club focal point. MCC sport's premier club custodian Laws cricket. New Laws introduced 18th century included three stump wicket leg wicket (lbw).The 19th century underarm bowling superseded roundarm overarm bowling. Both developments controversial. Organisation game county level led creation county clubs, starting Sussex 1839, ultimately formed official County Championship 1890. Meanwhile, British Empire instrumental spreading game overseas middle 19th century well established India, North America, Caribbean, South Africa, Australia New Zealand. In 1844, first-ever international match United States Canada. In 1859, team English players North America overseas tour.The Australian team tour overseas team Aboriginal stockmen travelled England 1868 play matches county teams. In 1862, English team tour Australia. The famous player 19th century W. G. Grace, started influential career 1865.In 1876–77, England team retrospectively recognised first-ever Test match Melbourne Cricket Ground Australia. The rivalry England Australia birth The Ashes 1882 remained Test cricket's famous contest. Test cricket began expand 1888–89 South Africa played England.The decades First World War called "Golden Age cricket". It nostalgic prompted collective sense loss war, period produce great players memorable matches, organised competition county Test level developed.The inter-war years dominated player: Australia's Don Bradman, statistically greatest batsman time. Test cricket continued expand 20th century addition West Indies, India New Zealand Second World War Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe Bangladesh post-war period. South Africa banned international cricket 1970 1992 apartheid boycott.Cricket entered 1963 English counties introduced limited overs variant. As produce result, limited overs cricket lucrative number matches increased. The Limited Overs International played 1971. The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) staged limited overs Cricket World Cup 1975. In 21st century, limited overs form, Twenty20, impact.While English team games hockey football international games, played world, cricket remained colonial game, limited countries British empire. The pre-industrial oddness cricket game export. It root countries British conquered ruled. In colonies cricket established popular sport white settlers local elites wanted copy habits colonial masters, India. Rules game-play Cricket bat ball game, played teams eleven players each. One team bats, attempting score runs, bowls fields ball, attempting restrict scoring dismiss batsmen. The objective game team score runs opponent. In forms cricket, dismiss opposition order match, drawn. Format game A cricket match divided periods called (which "s" singular plural form). It decided match teams each. During team fields bats. The teams switch fielding batting innings. All eleven members fielding team field, members batting team (two batsmen) field time. The order batsmen announced match, varied.A coin toss held team captains (who players) match starts: winner decides bat field first.The cricket field circular oval shape, rectangular pitch centre. The edge playing field marked boundary, fence, stands, rope painted line.At pitch wooden target called wicket; wickets 22 yards (20 m) apart. The pitch marked painted lines: bowling crease wicket, batting popping crease feet (122 cm) front it. The wicket three vertical stumps supporting small horizontal bails. A wicket bail dislodged, stump knocked (usually ball, batsman body, clothing equipment). This described breaking, knocking down, hitting wicket – ball hits wicket dislodge bail stump considered down.At instant batsman "owns" wicket (usually closer him) and, batting, safe ground. This bat touching ground popping crease. If wicket ball live ground dismissed, batsman safe.The batsmen positions opposite pitch. One designated member fielding team, called bowler, bowls ball pitch striking batsman end. The batsman bowling called non-striker, stands wicket, crease. The batsman allowed step forward creases, risk. Another member fielding team, wicket keeper, positioned striker's wicket.The fielding team's members stand pitch, spread field. The fielding captain tactically changes position balls.There umpire pitch.The bowler retreats yards (metres) wicket, runs (his run-up), releases ball over-hand reaches bowling crease. (If crosses crease releases ball, flexes elbow throw, ball, batsman dismissed, batting team penalty extra run. If ball passes wicket reach batsman called wide, extra run.) The ball bowled bounces pitch, lands exactly crease (a yorker), crosses crease bouncing (a toss).A ball count balls over.The batsman prevent ball hitting wicket striking ball bat. (This includes handle bat, gloves.) If bowler succeeds putting wicket batsman dismissed bowled out. If batsman misses ball, prevents reaching wicket, leg wicket, "LBW".If batsman hits ball caught fielder bouncing caught out. If caught bowler caught bowled; wicket keeper, caught behind.If batsman striking ball caught bouncing, batsmen score points (runs) team. Both batsmen length pitch, exchanging positions, grounding bats opposite crease. Each crossing grounding batsmen worth run. The batsmen attempt run, multiple runs, elect all. By attempting runs, batsmen risk dismissal. This fielding team retrieves ball hits wicket ball (either throwing it, holding it) batsman wicket reaches ground crease. The dismissed batsman out. Batsmen start run, change minds, return original positions.If batsman hits ball field boundary ball touching field, batting team scores runs. If ball touches ground reaches boundary, batting team scores runs. The batsmen started running ball reaches boundary, runs count.If batsman misses ball attempt extra runs : called byes. If ball bounces called leg bye.If striking batsman leaves ground misses ball, wicket keeper catch wicket – stumped.In case ball batsman choose strike ball, earning runs addition fixed penalty. If dismissed out.When batsmen finished attempting runs ball dead, returned bowler bowled again. The ball live starts up. The bowler continues bowl wicket, switch batsmen's positions.A batsman retire dismissed, reaching milestone runs (a century).A dismissed batsman leaves field, replaced batsman batting team. However, wicket down, ball caught, batsman dismissed fielding team appeal umpires decision, traditionally expression "How's that" (or "Howzat") (although batsman walk appeal). In matches, Test matches, team request review third umpire decision review system (DRS), includes TV replays electronic equipment Hawk-Eye, Hot Spot Snickometer.After bowler bowled (an over), member fielding team designated bowler, bowler fielding position. The batsmen stay place, bowler bowls opposite wicket, roles striker non-striker reverse. The wicket keeper umpires change positions, fielders, play continues. Bowlers (and do) bowl multiple innings, bowl overs succession.The complete 10 11 members batting team dismissed (all – remaining "not out"), set number overs played, batting team declares runs.The number number overs vary depending match. In match limited overs umpires session day number overs continuing (to avoid wasting team).The match completed. The umpires match case bad weather. But match team bat completed innings, team runs. In four-innings games team play second innings: team innings. If winning team completed innings, has, example, batsmen batted, "win wickets". If team bat loses match 50 fewer runs team, winning team "wins 50 runs". In rare event teams complete number runs, tie.In matches limited overs possibility draw: team fewer runs batsmen field game ends, out. This impact strategy: team declare closed accumulated runs, hope left dismiss team avoid draw, risking loss team scores runs. Pitch, wickets creases Playing surface Cricket played grassy field. The Laws Cricket size shape field, oval. In centre field rectangular strip, pitch.The pitch flat surface 10 feet (3.0 m) wide, short grass worn game progresses. At pitch, 22 yards (20 m) apart, wooden targets, wickets. These serve target bowling (also fielding) defended batting side, seeks accumulate runs. Stumps, bails creases Each wicket pitch consists three wooden stumps vertically, another. They surmounted wooden crosspieces called bails; total height wicket including bails 28.5 inches (720 mm) combined width three stumps, including small gaps 9 inches (230 mm).Four lines, creases, painted pitch wicket areas define batsman's "safe territory" determine limit bowler's approach. These called "popping" (or batting) crease, bowling crease "return" creases.The stumps bowling creases creases 22 yards (20 m) apart. A bowling crease 8 feet 8 inches (2.64 m) long, middle stump dead centre. The popping crease length, parallel bowling crease 4 feet (1.2 m) front wicket. The return creases perpendicular two; adjoined popping crease drawn bowling crease length 8 feet (2.4 m).When bowling ball, bowler's foot "delivery stride" land return creases front foot land popping crease. If bowler breaks rule, umpire calls "No ball".The popping crease batsman marks limit safe territory. He dismissed stumped (see Dismissals below) wicket broken "out ground". Bat ball The essence sport bowler delivers ball pitch batsman who, armed bat "on strike" end.The bat wood (usually White Willow) shape blade topped cylindrical handle. The blade 4.25 inches (108 mm) total length bat 38 inches (970 mm).The ball leather-seamed spheroid, circumference 9 inches (230 mm). The hardness ball, delivered speeds 90 miles hour (140 km/h), matter concern batsmen wear protective clothing including pads (designed protect knees shins), batting gloves hands, helmet head box inside trousers (to protect crotch area). Some batsmen wear additional padding inside shirts trousers thigh pads, arm pads, rib protectors shoulder pads. The ball "seam": rows stitches attaching leather shell ball string cork interior. The seam ball prominent, helps bowler propel predictable manner. During cricket matches, quality ball deteriorates point longer usable, course deterioration behaviour flight change influence match. Players attempt modify ball's behaviour modifying physical properties. Polishing ball wetting sweat saliva legal, polishing deliberately increase ball's swing, rubbing substances ball, scratching surface picking seam illegal ball tampering. Umpires scorers The game field regulated umpires, stands wicket bowler's end, position called "square leg", position 15–20 metres "on strike" batsman. The role umpires adjudicate ball correctly bowled (not ball wide), scored, batsman (the fielding appeal umpire, phrase How's That?). Umpires determine intervals start end, decide suitability playing conditions interrupt abandon match circumstances endanger players, damp pitch deterioration light.Off field televised matches, third umpire decisions incidents video evidence. The third umpire mandatory playing conditions Test matches limited overs internationals played ICC members. These matches match referee job ensure play Laws cricket spirit game.The match details, including runs dismissals, recorded official scorers, representing team. The scorers directed signals umpire. For example, umpire raises forefinger signal batsman (has dismissed); raises arms head batsman ball runs. The scorers required Laws cricket record runs scored, wickets overs bowled; practice, amounts additional data relating game. Innings The (ending 's' singular plural form) term collective performance batting side. Sometimes eleven members batting turn bat but, reasons, so. Depending type match played, team innings.The aim bowler, supported fielders, dismiss batsman. A batsman dismissed "out" leave field play replaced batsman team. When batsmen dismissed (i.e. out), team dismissed over. The batsman, dismissed, allowed continue batsmen "in". This batsman termed "not out".An three reasons: batting side's captain chosen "declare" closed (which tactical decision), batting achieved target game, game ended prematurely bad weather running time. In cases team's "not out" batsmen, declared closed fall wicket batsman joined play.In limited overs cricket, batsmen "not out" allotted overs bowled. Overs The bowler bowls ball sets deliveries (or "balls") set balls called over. This umpire calls "Over!" balls bowled. At point, bowler deployed end, fielding changes batsmen not. A bowler bowl successive overs, bowler (and does) bowl alternate overs, end, overs. The batsmen change over, non-striker striker vice versa. (Sometimes batsmen stronger player other, score single ball remain "on strike".) The umpires change positions square leg stands wicket non-striker's vice versa.The occasion bowler bowls consecutive overs Super Over directly final tied game limited-overs match. Team structure A team consists eleven players. Depending primary skills, player classified specialist batsman bowler. A well-balanced team specialist batsmen specialist bowlers. Teams include specialist wicket-keeper fielding position. Each team headed captain responsible making tactical decisions determining batting order, placement fielders rotation bowlers.A player excels batting bowling all-rounder. One excels batsman wicket-keeper "wicket-keeper/batsman", regarded type all-rounder. True all-rounders rare players focus batting bowling skills. Bowling The bowler reaches delivery stride "run-up", bowlers slow delivery couple steps bowling. A fast bowler momentum takes run-up, running fast so.The fastest bowlers deliver ball speed 90 miles hour (140 km/h) sheer speed defeat batsman, forced react quickly. Other fast bowlers mixture speed guile. Some fast bowlers seam ball "curves" "swings" flight. This type delivery deceive batsman mistiming shot ball touches edge bat "caught behind" wicketkeeper slip fielder.At bowling scale "spinner" bowls slow pace relies entirely guile deceive batsman. A spinner "buy wicket" "tossing up" (in slower, higher parabolic path) lure batsman making shot. The batsman wary deliveries "flighted" spun ball behave expects "trapped" out.In pacemen spinners "medium pacers" persistent accuracy rate scoring wear batsman's concentration.All bowlers classified style. The classifications, cricket terminology, confusing. Hence, bowler classified LF, meaning left arm fast bowler; LBG, meaning arm spin bowler bowls deliveries called "leg break" "Googly".During bowling action elbow held angle bend further, straighten out. If elbow straightens illegally square-leg umpire no-ball: "throwing" "chucking", difficult detect. The current laws allow bowler straighten arm 15 degrees less. Fielding All eleven players fielding field together. One wicket-keeper (or "keeper") operates wicket defended batsman strike. Wicket-keeping specialist occupation primary job gather deliveries batsman hit, batsmen byes. He wears gloves (he fielder allowed so), box groin, pads cover lower legs. He player batsman stumped.Apart currently bowling, fielders tactically deployed team captain chosen positions field.The captain member fielding determines tactics including bowl (and how); responsible "setting field", consultation bowler.In forms cricket, fielder injured match, substitute allowed field him. The substitute bowl, captain wicket. The substitute leaves field injured player fit return. Batting At time, batsmen playing area. One takes station striker's defend wicket score runs possible. His partner, non-striker, bowler operating.Batsmen bat batting order, decided team captain consulting team coach, captain bound consult coach. The batsmen – "openers" – face hostile bowling fresh fast bowlers ball. The batting positions competent batsmen team, team's bowlers – typically, always, skilled batsmen – typically bat last. The pre-announced batting order mandatory; wicket falls player batted next.If batsman "retires" (usually injury) return, "not out" retirement count dismissal, dismissed over. Substitute batsmen allowed.A skilled batsman array "shots" "strokes" defensive attacking mode. The idea ball best flat surface bat's blade. If ball touches bat called "edge". Batsmen seek ball possible, good player score runs making deft stroke turn wrists simply "blocking" ball directing fielders run.There variety shots played cricket. The batsman's repertoire includes strokes named style swing direction aimed: e.g., "cut", "drive", "hook", "pull".A batsman required play shot; event believes ball wicket opportunity score runs, "leave" ball wicketkeeper. Equally, attempt hits ball bat. He deliberately leg block ball "pad away", risky leg wicket rule.In event injured batsman fit bat run, umpires fielding captain allow member batting runner. The runner's task wickets incapacitated batsman, required wear carry exactly equipment batsman. As 2011 ICC outlawed runners felt abused. Runs The batsman strike (i.e. "striker") prevent ball hitting wicket, score runs hitting ball bat partner pitch fielding return ball. To register run, runners touch ground crease bats bodies (the batsmen carry bats run). Each completed increments score.More scored single hit: hits worth three runs common, size field difficult more. To compensate this, hits reach boundary field automatically awarded runs ball touches ground route boundary runs ball clears boundary touching ground boundary. In cases batsmen run.Hits unusual generally help "overthrows" fielder returning ball. If odd number runs scored striker, batsmen changed ends, non-striker striker. Only striker score individual runs, runs team's total.The decision attempt ideally batsman better view ball's progress, communicated calling: "yes", "no" "wait" heard.Running calculated risk fielder breaks wicket ball nearest batsman ground (i.e. bat contact ground popping crease), batsman out.A team's score reported terms number runs scored number batsmen dismissed. For example, batsmen team scored 224 runs, scored 224 loss 5 wickets (commonly shortened "224 five" written 224/5 or, Australia, "five 224" 5/224). Extras Additional runs gained batting team extras (called "sundries" Australia) errors fielding side. This achieved ways:No ball: penalty extra conceded bowler breaks rules bowling (a) inappropriate arm action; (b) overstepping popping crease; (c) foot return crease. In addition, bowler re-bowl ball. In limited overs matches, ball called bowling team's field setting fails comply restrictions. In shorter formats game (20–20, ODI) free rule introduced. The ball front foot no-ball free-hit batsman, safe losing wicket run-out.Wide: penalty extra conceded bowler bowls ball batsman's reach; ball, re-bowled. If ball crosses boundary, runs awarded batting (one wide, boundary).Bye: extra(s) awarded batsman misses ball wicketkeeper batsmen conventional (note mark good wicketkeeper restricts tally byes minimum).Leg bye: extra(s) awarded ball hits batsman's body, bat, attempting legitimate shot, fielders batsmen conventional way.When bowler bowled ball wide, team incurs additional penalty ball (i.e., delivery) bowled batting opportunity score runs extra ball. The batsmen (i.e., ball boundary four) claim byes leg byes count team total, striker's individual total runs scored bat. Dismissals There eleven batsman dismissed: common extremely rare. The common forms dismissal "bowled", "caught", "leg wicket" (lbw), "run out", (somewhat common) "stumped". Rare methods "hit wicket", "hit ball twice", "obstructed field", "handled ball" "timed out" – unknown professional game. The eleventh – retired – treated on-field dismissal retrospective fielder credited.If dismissal (for example "bowled" cases "caught") batsman voluntarily leave field umpire needing dismiss them. Otherwise umpire award dismissal declare batsman out, member fielding (generally bowler) "appeal". This invariably (or shouting) "how's that?" – reduced howzat? If umpire agrees appeal, raise forefinger "Out!". Otherwise shake head "Not out". Appeals loud circumstances claimed dismissal unclear, case lbw stumpings.Bowled: bowler wicket delivery wicket "broken" bail dislodged (if ball hits wicket dislodging bail out).Caught: batsman ball bat, holding bat, ball caught touched ground member fielding side.Leg wicket (lbw): ball batsman's (including clothing, pads etc. bat, holding bat) stumps. This rule exists prevent batsman guarding wicket legs bat. To lbw, ball bounce leg stump strike batsmen leg-stump. It bounce off-stump. The batsman dismissed lbw ball striking off-stump genuine attempt play ball bat.Run out: member fielding broken "put down" wicket ball nearest batsman ground; occurs accurate throw wicket, commonly throw wicketkeeper fielder standing wicket, batsmen attempting run, batsman "run out" attempting run; ground.Stumped wicketkeeper batsman missed bowled ball stepped ground, attempting run. A batsman No ball, stumped.Hit wicket: batsman wicket dislodges bails bat, person, clothing equipment receiving ball, setting received ball.Hit ball unusual introduced safety measure counter dangerous play protect fielders. The batsman legally play ball second ball hitting wicket played it. "Hit" refer batsman's bat.Obstructing field: unusual dismissal involve batsman deliberately (physically and/or verbally) fielder.Handled ball: batsman deliberately touch ball hand, example protect wicket. Note batsman's glove counts bat holding bat, batsmen frequently caught gloves (i.e. ball hits, deflected by, glove caught).Timed out; batsman receive delivery three minutes dismissed.Retired out: batsman retires umpire's permission, permission opposition captain resume innings.In vast majority cases, striker dismissal occurs. If non-striker dismissed out, dismissed obstructing field, handling ball timed out.A batsman leave field dismissed. If injured batsman temporarily retire, replaced batsman. This recorded retired hurt retired ill. The retiring batsman out, resume recovers. An unimpaired batsman retire, treated dismissed retired out; player credited dismissal. Batsmen bowled, caught, leg wicket, stumped wicket ball. They bowled, caught, leg wicket, ball wide. Some modes dismissal occur bowler bowling delivery. The batsman strike bowler leaves crease bowler bowls, batsman obstructing field retired time. Timed is, nature, dismissal delivery. With modes dismissal, batsman dismissed ball bowled. Innings closed An closed when:Ten eleven batsmen (have dismissed); case, team "all out"The team batsman left bat, remaining players unavailable injury, illness absence; again, team "all out"The team batting reaches score required matchThe predetermined number overs bowled (in one-day match only, commonly 50 overs; 20 Twenty20)A captain declares team's closed batsmen (this apply one-day limited matches) Results If team bats scored fewer runs opponents, team "lost runs" (where difference number runs scored teams). If team bats scores runs win, "won wickets", number wickets left fall. For instance team passes opponents' score lost wickets "by wickets".In two-innings-a-side match, team's combined second total side's total. The team greater score runs, bat again: difference teams' aggregate scores.If team batting out, scored number runs, match tie; rare matches side. In traditional game, allotted match expires win, game declared draw.If match single side, maximum number deliveries imposed. Such match called "limited overs" "one-day" match, scoring runs wins number wickets lost, draw occur. If kind match temporarily interrupted bad weather, complex mathematical formula, Duckworth-Lewis method developers, recalculate target score. A one-day match declared "no-result" fewer agreed number overs bowled team, circumstances resumption play impossible; example, wet weather. Distinctive elements Individual focus For team sport, cricket places individual players unusual scrutiny pressure. Bowler, batsman, fielder essentially independently other. While team managements signal bowler batsman pursue tactics, execution play series solitary acts. Cricket baseball team sports regard: individual focus cricket mitigated batting partnership practicalities running, enhanced fact batsman's continue hours. Spirit Game Cricket unique game addition laws, players abide "Spirit Game". The standard sportsmanship historically considered high phrase "it's cricket" coined 19th century describe unfair underhanded behaviour walk life. In decades though, financial incentives, high-level cricket increasingly fast-paced competitive, increasing appealing sledging, players expected abide umpires' rulings argument, do. Beginning 2001, MCC held annual lecture named Colin Cowdrey spirit game. Even modern game fielders signal umpire boundary hit, despite considered spectacular save (though TV replays anyway). In addition this, batsmen "walk" umpire declare out. This high level sportsmanship, batsman advantage incorrect umpiring decisions. Influence weather Cricket sport played drier periods year. But, so, weather factor cricket matches.Cricket played wet weather. Dampness bounce ball wicket risk players involved game. Many grounds facilities cover cricket pitch (or wicket). Covers tarpaulins laid wicket, elevated covers wheels (acting umbrella) hover covers airtight seal wicket. However, grounds facilities cover outfield. This event heavy rain, match cancelled, abandoned suspended unsafe outfield.Another factor cricket amount available. At grounds floodlights (or game formats disallow floodlights), umpires play event bad difficult batsmen (and extreme cases, fielders) ball them.The sight-screens white background help batsmen pick ball (or black background white ball).The umpires final decision weather-related issues. Uniqueness field Unlike sports, cricket playing fields vary size shape. While dimensions pitch infield regulated, Laws Cricket size shape field. The field boundaries painted marked rope. Pitch outfield variations balls behave fielded well batting. Pitches vary consistency, amount bounce, spin, seam movement bowler. Hard pitches good bat high bounce. Dry pitches deteriorate batting cracks appear, pitch, spinners play role. Damp pitches, pitches covered grass (termed "green" pitches), allow good fast bowlers extract extra bounce. Such pitches offer help fast bowlers match, better batting game on. While players outdoor sports deal variations field surface stadium covering, size shape fields standardised. Other local factors, altitude climate, play. These physical variations create distinctive set playing conditions ground. A ground acquire reputation batsman friendly bowler friendly discipline notably benefits unique mix elements. The absence standardised field games play out, nature team makeup players' statistical records. Types matches Cricket multi-faceted sport multiple formats, varying playing standard level formality desired match last. A pertinent division terms professional cricket matches limited teams apiece, limited number overs, single each. The former, first-class cricket, duration three days (there examples "timeless" matches too); latter, limited overs cricket team bowls limit typically 50 20 overs, planned duration day (a match extended bad weather, etc.).Typically, two-innings matches hours playing day. Limited overs matches hours more. There formal intervals day lunch informal breaks drinks. There short interval innings.Amateur cricketers rarely play matches longer single day; loosely divided declaration matches, maximum number overs assigned game total teams swap roles batting team completely dismissed declares; limited overs matches, maximum number overs assigned team's individually. These vary length 30 60 overs weekend ever-popular 20 evenings. Other forms cricket, indoor cricket garden cricket remain popular.Historically, cricket single wicket extremely contests 18th 19th centuries qualify matches. In form, team players, batsman face delivery bowled lasts. Single wicket rarely played limited overs cricket began. Test cricket Test cricket highest standard first-class cricket. A Test match international fixture teams representing countries Full Members ICC.Although term "Test match" coined later, Test cricket deemed begun matches Australia England 1876–77 Australian season.

Zimbabwe suspended Test status 2006 inability compete Test teams, returned 2011.Welsh players eligible play England, England Wales team. The West Indies team comprises players numerous Caribbean, notably Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad & Tobago, Leeward Islands Windward Islands.Test matches teams played group matches called "series". Matches days series consists three matches. Test matches finished allotted drawn. In case Test first-class cricket: possibility draw encourages team batting well bat defensively, faint chance avoid loss.Since 1882, Test series England Australia played trophy The Ashes. Some bilateral series individual trophies too: example, Wisden Trophy contested England West Indies; Frank Worrell Trophy Australia West Indies Border-Gavaskar Trophy India Australia. Limited overs Standard limited overs cricket introduced England 1963 season knockout cup contested first-class county clubs. In 1969, national league competition established. The concept gradually introduced leading cricket countries limited overs international played 1971. In 1975, Cricket World Cup England. Limited overs cricket innovations including multi-coloured kit floodlit matches white ball. A "one day match", named match scheduled completion single day, common limited overs cricket played international level. In practice, matches continue second day interrupted postponed bad weather. The objective limited overs match produce definite conventional draw possible, matches undecided scores tied bad weather prevents result. Each team plays faces limited number overs, maximum 50.

Another formal version indoor cricket played smaller arena soft ball pads invented years commonly played Southern Hemisphere, nominal international championships, including World Cups.In UK, garden cricket popular version sport, played gardens recreation grounds country adults children alike. Although cricket bat ball generally used, equipment pads gloves not. The exact rules vary based number participants space.Families teenagers play backyard cricket tennis ball cricket suburban yards driveways, cities India Pakistan play host countless games "Gully Cricket" "tape ball" narrow streets. Sometimes rules improvised: e.g. agreed fielders catch ball bounce claim wicket; people field players turns bat bowl. Tennis balls homemade bats used, variety objects serve wickets: example, batter's legs French cricket, fact originate France, played small children.In Kwik cricket, bowler wait batsman delivery, leading faster, exhausting game designed appeal children, physical education lessons UK schools. Another modification increase pace game "Tip Run", "Tipity" Run, "Tipsy Run" "Tippy-Go" rule, batter ball touches bat, contact unintentional minor.

Statistics Organized cricket lends statistics greater degree sports. Each play discrete small number outcomes. At professional level, statistics Test cricket, one-day internationals, first-class cricket recorded separately. However, Test matches first-class cricket, player's first-class statistics include Test match statistics – vice versa. The Guide Cricketers cricket annual edited Fred Lillywhite 1849 death 1866.

Parachuting, skydiving, method transiting high point Earth gravity, involving control speed descent parachute. It involve free-fall, parachute deployed gradually accelerates terminal velocity.The parachute jump history Andre-Jacques Garnerin, inventor parachute, October 22, 1797. Garnerin tested contraption leaping hydrogen balloon 3,200 feet Paris. Garnerin's parachute bore resemblance today's parachute's packed sort container feature ripcord. The intentional freefall jump ripcord-operated deployment century Leslie Irvin 1919. While Georgia Broadwick earlier freefall 1914 static entangled jump aircraft's tail assembly, freefall descent planned. Broadwick cut static deployed parachute manually, freeing aircraft entangled.The military developed parachuting technology save aircrews emergencies aboard balloons aircraft flight, delivering soldiers battlefield. Early competitions 1930s, international sport 1952. Common Parachuting performed recreational activity, competitive sport considered extreme sport risks involved. Modern militaries utilize parachuting deployment airborne forces supplies, operations forces commonly employ parachuting, free-fall parachuting, method insertion. Occasionally forest firefighters, "smokejumpers" United States, parachuting rapidly inserting forest fires remote inaccessible areas.Manually exiting aircraft parachuting safety aviators (especially military aviators aircrew), passengers escape aircraft land safely. While method escape rare modern times, commonly World War I military aviators, utilized extensively air wars World War II. In modern times, common escape aircraft distress ejection seat. Said system operated pilot, aircrew member, passenger, engaging activation device manually. In designs, lead seat propelled aircraft carrying occupant it, explosive charge rocket propulsion system. Once clear aircraft, ejection seat deploy parachute, older models entrusted step manual activation seat's occupant. Safety Despite perception danger, fatalities rare. About 21 skydivers confirmed killed year US, roughly death 150,000 jumps (about 0.0007%).In US western world, skydivers required carry parachutes. The reserve parachute periodically inspected re-packed (whether not) certified parachute rigger (in US, FAA certificated parachute rigger). Many skydivers automatic activation device (AAD) opens reserve parachute pre-determined altitude detects skydiver free fall. Depending country, AADs mandatory jumpers, and/or required jumpers experience level. Most skydivers wear visual altimeter, increasing number audible altimeters fitted helmets.Injuries fatalities occurring functional parachute skydiver performed unsafe maneuvers error judgment flying canopy, typically high-speed impact ground hazards ground. One common sources injury turn high-performance canopy swooping. Swooping advanced discipline gliding high-speed parallel ground landing.Changing wind conditions risk factor. In conditions winds, turbulence hot days parachutist caught downdrafts close ground. Shifting winds crosswind downwind landing higher injury wind speed adding landing speed.Another risk factor "canopy collisions", collisions skydivers inflated parachutes. Canopy collisions jumpers' inflated parachutes entangle other, sudden collapse (deflation) involved parachutes. When occurs, jumpers perform emergency procedures (if altitude so) "cut-away" (jettison) canopies deploy reserve canopies. Canopy collisions dangerous occurring altitudes allow jumpers adequate safely jettison parachutes deploy reserve parachutes.Equipment failure rarely fatalities injuries. Approximately 750 deployments parachute malfunction. Ram-air parachutes typically spin uncontrollably malfunctioning, jettisoned deploying reserve parachute. Reserve parachutes packed deployed differently; designed conservatively built tested exacting standards reliable parachutes, safety advantage probability malfunction multiplied probability reserve malfunction. This yields smaller probability double malfunction possibility malfunction cutaway causing reserve malfunction risk.Parachuting disciplines BASE jumping involve equipment suit flying sky surfing higher risk factor lower mobility jumper greater risk entanglement. For reason, disciplines generally practiced experienced jumpers.Depictions commercial films – notably Hollywood action movies – overstate dangers sport. Often, characters films performing feats physically impossible effects assistance. In cases, practices grounded shunned safety-conscious drop zone club. USPA member drop zones US Canada required experienced jumper "safety officer" (in Canada DSO – Drop Zone Safety Officer; U.S. S&TA – Safety Training Advisor) responsible dealing jumpers violate rules, regulations, fashion deemed unsafe appointed individual.In countries, local regulations liability-conscious prudence drop zone owners require parachutists attained majority engaging sport.The skydive performed parachute stuntman Gary Connery 23 May 2012 732 m. Most common injuries Due hazardous nature skydiving, greatest precautions avoid parachuting injuries death. For solo-parachutists, includes 4 8 hours ground instruction. Since majority parachute injuries occur landing (approximately 85%), greatest emphasis ground training proper parachute landing fall (PLF), seeks orient evenly disperse impact flexion large, insulating muscles (such medial gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, rectus femoris, vastus medialis, biceps femoris, semitendinosus ), opposed individual bones, tendons, ligaments break tear easily.Parachutists, flying smaller sport canopies, land dangerous amounts kinetic energy, reason, improper landings 30% skydiving injuries deaths. Often, injuries sustained parachute landing caused single outstretched limb, foot, extended separately rest body, causing sustain forces disproportional support structures within. This tendency displayed chart, higher proportion wrist ankle injuries 186 injured 110,000 parachute jump study:Due possibility fractures (commonly occurring tibia ankle mortise), recommended parachutists wear supportive footwear. Supportive footwear prevents outward ankle rolling, allowing PLF safely transfer impact energy true ankle joint, dissipate medial gastrocnemius tibialis anterior muscles. Weather Parachuting weather, thunderstorms, high winds, dust devils dangerous activity. Reputable drop zones suspend operations inclement weather. In United States, USPA's Basic Safety Requirements prohibit solo student skydivers jumping winds exceeding 14 mph ram-air equipment. However, maximum ground winds unlimited licensed skydivers. Visibility As parachuting aviation activity visual flight rules, generally illegal jump clouds, relevant rules governing airspace, FAR105 US Faldskærmsbestemmelser (Parachuting Ordinances) Denmark. Jumpers pilots dropping aircraft bear responsibility VFR elements, ensuring air traffic moment jump create hazard. Canopy collisions A collision canopy statistical hazard, avoided observing simple principles, including knowing upper wind speeds, number party members exit groups, exit separation jumpers. In 2013, 17% skydiving fatalities United States mid-air collisions. Training Skydiving practised jumping. Vertical wind tunnels practise free fall ("indoor skydiving" "bodyflight"), virtual reality parachute simulators practise parachute control.Beginning skydivers seeking training options:Static lineInstructor-assisted deploymentAccelerated freefallTandem skydiving Parachute deployment At sport skydiver's deployment altitude, individual manually deploys small pilot-chute acts drogue, catching air pulling parachute canopy. There principal systems use: "throw-out", skydiver pulls toggle attached pilot-chute stowed small pocket container: "pull-out", skydiver pulls small pad attached pilot-chute stowed inside container.Throw-out pilot-chute pouches positioned bottom container – B.O.C. deployment system – older harnesses leg-mounted pouches. The safe flat-flying, unsuitable freestyle head-down flying.In typical civilian sport parachute system, pilot-chute connected "bridle", turn attached small deployment bag folded parachute canopy suspension lines, stowed rubber bands. At bottom container holds deployment bag closing loop which, packing, fed grommets flaps close container. At point, curved pin attached bridle inserted closing loop. The step involves folding pilot-chute placing pouch (e.g., B.O.C pouch).Activation pilot-chute thrown out. It inflates creates drag, pulling pin closing loop allowing pilot-chute pull deployment bag container. The parachute lines pulled loose rubber bands extend canopy starts open. A rectangular piece fabric called "slider" (which separates parachute lines groups fed grommets corners slider) slows opening parachute works canopy open slider head skydiver. The slider slows controls deployment parachute. Without slider, parachute inflate fast, damaging parachute fabric and/or suspension lines, well causing discomfort, injury death jumper. During deployment, skydiver generally experience seconds intense deceleration, realm 3 4 g, parachute slows descent 190 km/h (120 mph) 28 km/h (17 mph).If skydiver experiences malfunction parachute correct, pull "cut-away" handle front right-hand harness (on chest) release canopy harness/container. Once free malfunctioning canopy, reserve canopy activated manually pulling second handle front left harness. Some containers fitted connecting reserve parachutes – reserve static (RSL) – pulls open reserve container faster manual release could. Whichever method used, spring-loaded pilot-chute extracts reserve parachute upper half container. Disciplines maneuvers Accuracy One example "Hit Rock", variant accuracy landing devised people varying skill levels compete fun. "Hit Rock" originally POPS (Parachutists Over Phorty Society). The object land close chair, remove parachute harness, sprint chair, sit chair rock time. The contestant timed moment feet touch ground rock completed. This event considered race. Angle Flying Angle Flying presented 2000 World Freestyle Competitions, European Espace Boogie, Eloy Freefly Festival.The technique consists flying diagonally determinate relation angle trajectory speed body, air stream allows control flight. The aim level angle, perform aerial games, freestyle, three-dimensional flight grip, acrobatic free-flying. Base Jumping Camera flying Classic accuracy Classic accuracy running opened parachute, individual team contest. The aim touch target center 2 cm diameter. The target deep foam mattress air-filled landing pad. An electronic recording pad 32 cm diameter set middle. It measures score 1 cm increments 16 cm displays landing.The competition 8 rounds. Then individual competition, 8 selective rounds, 25% jump semi-final round. After semi-final round, 50% selected final round. The competitor lowest cumulative score declared winner.Competitors jump teams 5 maximum, exiting aircraft 1000 1200 meters opening parachutes sequentially allow competitor clear approach target.This sport unpredictable weather conditions play part. So classic accuracy requires high adaptability aerology excellent steering control.It interesting discipline spectator closeness action (a metres) possibility practised (sport ground, stadium, urban place...). Today, classic accuracy practiced (in competition) discipline skydiving world. Cross-country A cross-country jump skydive participants open parachutes jumping, intention covering ground canopy possible. Usual distance jump dropzone miles.There variations cross-country jump:The popular plan exit point upwind drop zone. A map wind direction velocity altitudes determine exit point. This set distance participants drop zone.The variation jump directly drop zone wind possible. This increases risks jump substantially, participants find suitable landing area altitude.Two-way radios cell-phones landed safely, and, case landing drop zone, find parachutist ground crew pick up. Formation skydiving Formation Skydiving (FS) born California, USA 1960‘s. The documented skydiving occurred Arvin, California March 1964 Mitch Poteet, Don Henderson, Andy Keech Lou Paproski formed 4-man star formation, photographed Bob Buquor. This discipline referred skydiving community Relative Work, abbreviated RW, Relly Rel. Freeflying Night jumps Parachuting restricted daytime hours; experienced skydivers perform night jumps. For safety reasons, requires equipment daytime jump jurisdictions, requires advanced skydiving license (at B-License U.S.) meeting local safety official covering load. A altimeter (preferably accompanied audible altimeter) must. Skydivers performing night jumps flashlights check canopies properly deployed.Visibility skydivers aircraft consideration; FAA regulations require skydivers jumping night wearing visible three miles (5 km) direction, turn canopy. A chem-light(glowstick) good idea night jump.Night jumpers aware dark zone, landing night. Above 30 meters (100 feet) jumpers flying canopy good view landing zone reflected ambient light/moon light. Once close ground, ambient source lost, angle reflection. The lower get, darker ground looks. At 100 feet landing black hole. Suddenly dark, jumper hits ground after. This ground rush explained to, anticipated by, night jumper. Recommendations jumper utilize canopy larger typically day jump attempt schedule night jump close moon easier ground.While dangerous regular skydiving difficult schedule, night jumps required USPA jumper D license. Pond swooping Pond swooping competitive parachuting canopy pilots attempt touch glide small water, shore. Events lighthearted competition, rating accuracy, speed, distance style. Points peer approval reduced participant "chows", fails reach shore sinks water. Swoop ponds deep drown ordinary circumstances, danger concussive force incorrectly executed maneuver. In order distance, swoopers increase speed executing "hook turn", speed difficulty increase angle turn. Hook turns commonly measured increments 90 degrees. As angle turn increases, horizontal vertical speed increased, misjudgement altitude imprecise manipulation canopy's control structures (front risers, rear risers, toggles) lead high speed impact pond Earth. Prevention injury reason pond swooping grass landing area. Skysurfing Space Ball This skydivers ball weighs 100-200 grams release free fall. The ball maintains fall rate skydivers. The skydivers pass ball whilst free fall. At predetermined altitude, "ball master" catch ball hold ensure impact ground. Style Style considered sprint parachuting. This individual discipline played free fall.The idea maximum speed complete pre-designated series maneuvers fast cleanly (speed exceed 400 km/h / 250 mph)Jumps filmed ground based camera (with exceptional lens record performance).Performance timed (from start maneuver completion) judged public jump. Competition includes 4 qualifying rounds final 8. Competitors jump height 2200 2500 m.They rush acceleration stage 15 20 seconds series maneuvers benefiting maximum stored speed.Those series consist Turns Back-Loops achieve pre-designated order. The incorrect performance maneuvers penalties runtime.The performance athlete defined seconds hundredths second. The competitor lowest cumulative declared winner.Notice complete sequence performed leading international experts 6 seconds, penalties included. Stuff jumps Thanks unpopulated areas jump over, 'stuff' jumps possible. Also "zoo jumps", jumps skydivers jump object. Rubber raft jumps popular; jumpers sit rubber raft. Cars, bicycles, motorcycles, vacuum cleaners, water tanks, inflatable companions thrown aircraft. At altitude, jumpers break object deploy parachutes, leaving smash ground terminal velocity. Swoop chug A tradition drop zones swoop chug. As parachutists land load day, skydivers landing skydivers beer customarily chugged landing area. This timed friendly competition informal, untimed, kick-off night's festivities. Tracking Tracking skydivers position achieve high forward speed, allowing cover great distance ground. Tracking group jumps achieve separation jumpers parachute deployment. The tracking position involves sweeping arms straightening legs toes pointed. Tunnel flying Using vertical wind tunnel simulate free fall discipline training competitions, teams, figures. Wingsuit flying 'Wingsuit flying' 'wingsuiting' sport flying air wingsuit, adds surface area human enable increase lift. The common type wingsuit creates extra surface area fabric legs arms. Organizations National parachuting associations exist countries, affiliated Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), promote sport. In cases, national representative bodies, well local drop zone operators, require participants carry certification attesting training level experience sport, proven competence. Anyone produce bona-fides treated student, requiring close supervision.The sole organization United States United States Parachute Association (USPA), issues licenses ratings, governs skydiving, represents skydiving government agencies. USPA publishes Skydivers Information Manual (SIM) resources. In Canada, Canadian Sport Parachuting Association lead organization. In South Africa, sport managed Parachute Association South Africa, United Kingdom British Parachute Association. In Brazil CNP (Comapnhia Nacional Paraquedismo) sets Boituva, records broken 2nd largest center largest Southern Hemisphere.Within sport, associations promote safety, technical advances, training-and-certification, competition interests members. Outside communities, promote sport public intercede government regulators.Competitions organized regional, national international levels disciplines. Some offer amateur competition.Many photogenic/videogenic variants enjoy sponsored events prize money winners.The majority jumpers non-competitive, enjoying opportunity skydive friends weekends holidays. The atmosphere gatherings relaxed, sociable welcoming newcomers. Skydiving events, called "boogies", arranged local, national international scale year, attracting young jumpers elders – Parachutists Over Phorty (POPs), Skydivers Over Sixty (SOS) older groups. Drop zones In parachuting, drop zone DZ area location parachutist freefalls expects land. It situated small airport, sharing facility general aviation activities. There generally landing area designated parachute landings. Drop zone staff includes DZO (drop zone operator owner), manifestors, pilots, instructors, coaches, cameramen, packers, riggers general staff. Equipment Costs sport trivial. As technological advances performance enhancements introduced, equipment increase price. Similarly, average skydiver carries equipment earlier years, safety devices (such AAD) contributing portion cost.A set brand-new equipment easily cost motorcycle half small car. The market permit steady lowering prices equipment computers.A canopy experienced parachutist cost $2,000 $3,000 US Higher performance Tandem Parachutes cost more, whilst docile student parachutes cost less.In countries, sport supports used-equipment market. For beginners, preferred acquire "gear", advantages users can:Try types parachutes (there many) learn style prefer, paying price equipment.Acquire complete system peripheral items short reduced cost.Novices generally start parachutes docile jumper's weight. As improve skill confidence, graduate smaller, faster, responsive parachutes. An active jumper change parachutes space years retaining harness/container peripheral equipment.Older jumpers, jump weekends summer, direction, selecting larger, gentle parachutes demand youthful intensity reflexes jump. They adhering maxim that: "There jumpers bold jumpers, old, bold jumpers." (Pilots saying.)Most parachuting equipment ruggedly designed enjoyed owners retired. Purchasers advised purchases examined qualified parachute rigger. A rigger trained spot signs damage misuse. Riggers track industry product safety bulletins, can, therefore, determine piece equipment up-to-date serviceable.

The video video game traditionally referred raster display device, 2000s, implies type display device produce two- three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games form, designation controversial.The electronic systems play video games platforms; examples personal computers video game consoles. These platforms range mainframe computers small handheld computing devices. Specialized video games arcade games, video game components housed large, typically coin-operated chassis, common 1980s video arcades, gradually declined widespread availability affordable video game consoles (e.g., PlayStation 4, Xbox One Nintendo Wii U) video games desktop laptop computers smartphones.The input device games, game controller, varies platforms. Common controllers include gamepads, joysticks, mouse devices, keyboards, touchscreens mobile devices, buttons, even, Kinect sensor, person's hands body. Players typically view game video screen television computer monitor, virtual reality head-mounted display goggles. There game sound effects, music and, 2010s, voice actor lines loudspeakers headphones. Some games 2000s include haptic, vibration-creating effects, force feedback peripherals virtual reality headsets. In 2010s, video game industry increasing commercial importance, growth driven emerging Asian markets mobile games, played smartphones. As 2015, video games generated sales USD 74 billion annually worldwide, third-largest segment U.S. entertainment market, broadcast cable TV. History Early games interactive electronic devices display formats. The earliest example 1947—a "Cathode ray tube Amusement Device" filed patent 25 January 1947, Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. Estle Ray Mann, issued 14 December 1948, U.S. Patent 2455992.

Modeled 1960s prototype console developed Ralph H. Baer called "Brown Box", standard television. These versions Atari's Pong; arcade version 1972 version 1975 dramatically increased video game popularity. The commercial Pong led numerous companies develop Pong clones systems, spawning video game industry.A flood Pong clones eventually led video game crash 1977, mainstream Taito's 1978 shooter game Space Invaders, marking golden arcade video games inspiring dozens manufacturers enter market. The game inspired arcade machines prevalent mainstream locations shopping malls, traditional storefronts, restaurants, convenience stores. The game subject numerous articles stories television newspapers magazines, establishing video gaming rapidly growing mainstream hobby. Space Invaders licensed Atari VCS (later Atari 2600), "killer app" quadrupling console's sales. This helped Atari recover earlier losses, turn Atari VCS revived video game market second generation consoles, North American video game crash 1983. The video game industry revitalized shortly widespread Nintendo Entertainment System, marked shift dominance video game industry United States Japan third generation consoles. Overview Platforms The term "platform" refers combination electronic components computer hardware which, conjunction software, allows video game operate. The term "system" commonly used. The distinctions clear games bridge platforms. In addition personal computers, devices ability play games dedicated video game machines, smartphones, PDAs graphing calculators. PC In common "PC game" refers involves player interacting personal computer connected video monitor. Personal computers dedicated game platforms, differences running game hardwares, openness allows features developers reduced software cost, increased flexibility, increased innovation, emulation, creation modifications ("mods"), open hosting online gaming (in person plays video game people household) others. Console A "console game" played specialized electronic device connects common television set composite video monitor, PCs, sorts computer programs, console dedicated video game platform manufactured company. Usually consoles games developed it, games platform company, games developed direct competitor, game platforms. It game controller. Major console platforms include XBox Playstation. Handheld A "handheld" gaming device small, self-contained electronic device portable held user's hands. It features console, small screen, speakers buttons, joystick game controllers single unit. Like consoles, handhelds dedicated platforms, share characteristics. Handheld hardware powerful PC console hardwares. Some handheld games 1970s 1980s play game. In 1990s 2000s, number handheld games cartridges, enabled play games. Arcade "Arcade game" generally refers game played specialized type electronic device typically designed play game encased special, coin-operated cabinet built-in console, controllers (joystick, buttons, etc.), CRT screen, audio amplifier speakers. Arcade games brightly painted logos images relating theme game. While arcade games housed vertical cabinet, user typically stands front play, arcade games tabletop approach, display screen housed table-style cabinet see-through table top. With table-top games, users typically sit play. In 1990s 2000s, arcade games offered players choice multiple games. In 1980s, video arcades businesses game players number arcade video games. In 2010s, fewer video arcades, movie theaters family entertainment centers them. Web browser The web browser established platform 2000s, providing cross-platform environment video games designed played spectrum hardware personal computers tablet computers smartphones. This turn generated terms qualify classes web browser-based games. These games identified based website appear, "Facebook" games. Others named based programming platform develop them, Java Flash games. Genres A video game, forms media, categorized genres. Video game genres categorize video games based gameplay interaction visual narrative differences. A video game genre defined set gameplay challenges classified independent setting game-world content, works fiction films books. For example, shooter game shooter game, takes fantasy outer space.Because genres dependent content definition, genres changed evolved newer styles video games existence. Ever advancing technology production values video game development fostered lifelike complex games turn introduced enhanced genre possibilities (e.g., virtual pets), pushed boundaries existing video gaming cases possibilities play (such titles designed devices Sony's EyeToy). Some genres represent combinations others, massively multiplayer online role-playing games, or, commonly, MMORPGs. It common higher level genre terms collective nature genres action, music/rhythm horror-themed video games. Classifications Casual games Casual games derive accessibility, simple understand gameplay grasp rule sets. Additionally, casual games frequently support ability jump play demand. Casual games existed term coined include video games Solitaire Minesweeper commonly pre-installed versions Microsoft Windows operating system. Examples genres category match three, hidden object, management, puzzle tower defense style games. Casual games generally stores online retailers PopCap, Zylom GameHouse provided free play web portals Newgrounds. While casual games commonly played personal computers, phones tablets, on-line console system download services (e.g., PlayStation Network, WiiWare Xbox Live). Serious games Serious games games designed convey learning experience player. Some serious games fail qualify video game traditional sense term. Educational software typically fall category (e.g., touch typing tutors, language learning programs, etc.) primary distinction appear based title's primary goal well target demographics. As categories, description guideline rule. Serious games games generally reasons simple entertainment core casual games include works genre, exercise games, educational games, propaganda games higher representation group subject matter. These games typically designed played professionals job skill set improvement. They created convey social-political awareness subject.One longest-running serious games franchises Microsoft Flight Simulator published 1982 name. The United States military virtual reality based simulations, VBS1 training exercises, growing number responder roles (e.g., police, firefighters, EMTs). One example non-game environment utilized platform serious game development virtual Second Life, currently United States governmental departments (e.g., NOAA, NASA, JPL), Universities (e.g., Ohio University, MIT) educational remote learning programs businesses (e.g., IBM, Cisco Systems) meetings training.Tactical video games plays crucial role making statement conveying message relevant issues. This allows broader audience receive access reached people. An example tactical video games newsgames. These short games contemporary events designed illustrate point. For example, Take Action Games game studio collective co-founded Susana Ruiz serious games. Some games include Darfur Dying, Finding Zoe, In The Balance. All games bring awareness issues events intelligent well thought manner. Educational games On 23 September 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama launched campaign called "Educate Innovate" aimed improving technological, mathematical, scientific engineering abilities American students. This campaign plans harness power interactive games help achieve goal students excelling departments. This campaign stemmed opportunities video game realm contributed competitions. Some competitions include Stem National Video Game Competition Imagine Cup. Both examples events bring focus relevant current issues addressed sense video games educate spread knowledge media. www.NobelPrize.org games entice user learn pertaining Nobel prize achievements engaging fun play video game. There types styles educational games counting spelling games kids games adults. Some games targeted audience mind intended simply educate views plays game. Controllers Video game types input devices translate human actions game, common game controllers keyboard mouse "PC games, consoles gamepads, handheld consoles built buttons. Other game controllers commonly games racing wheels, guns pads. Digital cameras game controllers capturing movements player.As technology continues advance, controller player immersive experience playing games. There controllers presets buttons mapped playing games easier. Along presets, player custom map buttons better accommodate play style. On keyboard mouse, actions game preset keyboard. Most games allow player change actions mapped liking. The companies design controllers controller visually appealing feel comfortable hands consumer.An example technology incorporated controller touchscreen. It allows player interact game differently before. The person move menus easier interact objects game. They pick objects, equip others, move objects players path. Another example motion sensor persons movement captured game. Some motion sensor games based controller is. Th reason signal ffrom controller console computer actions create certian movements game. Other type motion sensor games webcam style person move infront actions repeated character game playing as. Development Video game development authorship, entertainment, frequently cross-disciplinary field. Video game developers, employees industry commonly referred, include programmers graphic designers. Over years expanded include type skill prevalent creation movie television program, including sound designers, musicians, technicians; well skills video games, game designer. All managed producers.In days industry, common single person manage roles needed create video game. As platforms complex powerful type material present, larger teams needed generate art, programming, cinematography, more. This "one-man shop" gone, casual gaming handheld markets, smaller games prevalent technical limitations limited RAM lack dedicated 3D graphics rendering capabilities target platform (e.g., cellphones PDAs).With growth size development teams industry, problem cost increased. Development studios pay staff competitive wage order attract retain best talent, publishers constantly costs order maintain profitability investment. Typically, video game console development team range sizes 5 50 people, teams exceeding 100. In May 2009, game project reported development staff 450. The growth team size combined greater pressure completed projects market recouping production costs led greater occurrence missed deadlines, rushed games release unfinished products. Downloadable content A phenomenon additional game content date, additional funds, began digital video game distribution downloadable content (DLC). Developers digital distribution issue storylines game released, Rockstar Games Grand Theft Auto IV (The Lost Damned The Ballad Gay Tony), Bethesda Fallout 3 expansions. New gameplay modes available, instance, Call Duty zombie modes, multiplayer mode Mushroom Wars higher difficulty level Metro: Last Light. Smaller packages DLC common, ranging better in-game weapons (Dead Space, Just Cause 2), character outfits (LittleBigPlanet, Minecraft), songs perform (SingStar, Rock Band, Guitar Hero). Expansion Pack A variation downloadable content expansion packs. Unlike DLC, expansion packs game existed game's code developed game released.

Theory Although departments computer science studying technical aspects video games years, theories examine games artistic medium development humanities. The visible schools emerging field ludology narratology. Narrativists approach video games context Janet Murray calls "Cyberdrama". That say, major concern video games storytelling medium, arises interactive fiction. Murray puts video games context Holodeck, fictional piece technology Star Trek, arguing video game medium player allowed person, world. This image video games received widespread popular support, forms basis films Tron, eXistenZ The Last Starfighter.Ludologists break sharply radically idea. They argue video game foremost game, understood terms rules, interface, concept play deploys. Espen J. Aarseth argues that, games plots, characters, aspects traditional narratives, aspects incidental gameplay. For example, Aarseth critical widespread attention narrativists heroine game Tomb Raider, "the dimensions Lara Croft's body, analyzed death film theorists, irrelevant player, different-looking play differently... When I play, I body, it." Simply put, ludologists reject traditional theories claim artistic socially relevant qualities video game determined underlying set rules, demands, expectations imposed player.While games emergent principles, video games commonly simulated story worlds emergent behavior occurs context game. The term "emergent narrative" describe how, simulated environment, storyline created simply "what player." However, emergent behavior limited sophisticated games. In general, event-driven instructions occur AI game, emergent behavior exist. For instance, racing game cars programmed avoid crashing, encounter obstacle track: cars maneuver avoid obstacle causing cars slow and/or maneuver accommodate cars front obstacle. The programmer wrote code create traffic jam, exists game. Emulation An emulator program replicates behavior video game console, allowing games platform original hardware. Emulators exist PCs, smartphones consoles original. Emulators generally play games, hack existing games, translate unreleased games region, enhanced features games improved graphics, speed down, bypass regional lockouts, online multiplayer support.Some manufacturers released official emulators consoles. For example, Virtual Console allows users play games Nintendo consoles Wii, Wii U, 3DS. Virtual Console Nintendo's strategy deterring video game piracy. In November 2015, Microsoft launched backwards compatibility Xbox 360 games Xbox One console emulation. Also, Sony announced relaunching PS2 games PS4 emulation. According Sony Computer Entertainment America v. Bleem, creating emulator proprietary video game console legal. However, Nintendo claims emulators promote distribution illegally copied games. Social aspects Demographics The November 2005 Nielsen Active Gamer Study, survey 2,000 regular gamers, U.S. games market diversifying. The group male players expanded 25–40 group. For casual online puzzle-style simple mobile cell phone games, gender divide equal men women. More growing segment female players engaged aggressive style games historically considered fall traditionally male genres (e.g., first-person shooters). According ESRB, 41% PC gamers women.

Personal computer systems Atari Commodore regularly featured game ports. PC-based computer games started lower availability multiplayer options technical limitations. PCs typically game ports all. Network games personal computers generally limited text based adventures MUDs played remotely dedicated server. This slow speed modems (300-1200-bit/s), prohibitive cost involved putting computer online multiple visitors it. However, advent widespread local area networking technologies Internet based online capabilities, number players modern games 32 higher, featuring integrated text and/or voice chat. Massively multiplayer online game (MMOs) offer extremely high numbers simultaneous players; Eve Online set record 65,303 players single server 2013. Behavioral effects It action video game players better hand–eye coordination visuo-motor skills, resistance distraction, sensitivity peripheral vision ability count presented objects, nonplayers. Researchers enhanced abilities acquired training action games, involving challenges switch attention locations, games requiring concentration single objects. It suggested studies online/offline video gaming therapeutic tool treatment mental health concerns.In Steven Johnson's book, Everything Bad Is Good You, argues video games fact demand player traditional games Monopoly. To experience game, player determine objectives, well complete them. They learn game controls human-machine interface works, including menus HUDs. Beyond skills, fundamental granted gamers, video games based player navigating (and eventually mastering) highly complex system variables. This requires analytical ability, well flexibility adaptability. He argues process learning boundaries, goals, controls game highly demanding calls areas cognitive function. Indeed, games require great deal patience focus player, and, contrary popular perception games instant gratification, games delay gratification longer forms entertainment film books. Some suggests video games increase players' attention capacities.Learning principles video games identified techniques reform U.S. education system. It noticed gamers attitude playing high concentration, realize learning, attitude school, education enjoy benefits.

A central processing unit (CPU) electronic circuitry computer carries instructions computer program performing basic arithmetic, logical, control input/output (I/O) operations instructions. The computer industry term "central processing unit" 1960s. Traditionally, term "CPU" refers processor, processing unit control unit (CU), distinguishing core elements computer external components memory I/O circuitry.The form, design implementation CPUs changed course history, fundamental operation remains unchanged. Principal components CPU include arithmetic logic unit (ALU) performs arithmetic logic operations, processor registers supply operands ALU store ALU operations, control unit orchestrates fetching (from memory) execution instructions directing coordinated operations ALU, registers components.Most modern CPUs microprocessors, meaning contained single integrated circuit (IC) chip. An IC CPU memory, peripheral interfaces, components computer; integrated devices variously called microcontrollers systems chip (SoC). Some computers employ multi-core processor, single chip CPUs called "cores"; context, speak single chips "sockets". Array processors vector processors multiple processors operate parallel, unit considered central. There exists concept virtual CPUs abstraction dynamical aggregated computational resources. History Early computers ENIAC physically rewired perform tasks, caused machines called "fixed-program computers". Since term "CPU" generally defined device software (computer program) execution, earliest devices rightly called CPUs advent stored-program computer.The idea stored-program computer design J. Presper Eckert John William Mauchly's ENIAC, initially finished sooner. On June 30, 1945, ENIAC made, mathematician John von Neumann distributed paper entitled First Draft Report EDVAC. It outline stored-program computer eventually completed August 1949. EDVAC designed perform number instructions (or operations) types. Significantly, programs written EDVAC stored high-speed computer memory physical wiring computer. This overcame severe limitation ENIAC, considerable effort required reconfigure computer perform task. With von Neumann's design, program EDVAC changed simply changing contents memory. EDVAC, however, stored-program computer; Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine, small prototype stored-program computer, program 21 June 1948 Manchester Mark 1 program night 16–17 June 1949.Early CPUs custom designs larger distinctive computer. However, method designing custom CPUs application development multi-purpose processors produced quantities. This standardization began discrete transistor mainframes minicomputers rapidly accelerated popularization integrated circuit (IC). The IC allowed increasingly complex CPUs designed manufactured tolerances order nanometers. Both miniaturization standardization CPUs increased presence digital devices modern life limited application dedicated computing machines. Modern microprocessors appear electronic devices ranging automobiles cellphones, toys.While von Neumann credited design stored-program computer design EDVAC, design von Neumann architecture, him, Konrad Zuse, suggested implemented ideas. The so-called Harvard architecture Harvard Mark I, completed EDVAC, utilized stored-program design punched paper tape electronic memory. The difference von Neumann Harvard architectures separates storage treatment CPU instructions data, memory space both. Most modern CPUs von Neumann design, CPUs Harvard architecture well, embedded applications; instance, Atmel AVR microcontrollers Harvard architecture processors.Relays vacuum tubes (thermionic tubes) commonly switching elements; computer requires thousands tens thousands switching devices. The speed system dependent speed switches. Tube computers EDVAC tended average hours failures, relay computers (slower, earlier) Harvard Mark I failed rarely. In end, tube-based CPUs speed advantages afforded generally outweighed reliability problems. Most synchronous CPUs clock rates compared modern microelectronic designs. Clock signal frequencies ranging 100 kHz 4 MHz common time, limited speed switching devices built with. Transistor CPUs The design complexity CPUs increased technologies facilitated building smaller reliable electronic devices. The improvement advent transistor. Transistorized CPUs 1950s 1960s longer built bulky, unreliable, fragile switching elements vacuum tubes relays. With improvement complex reliable CPUs built printed circuit boards discrete (individual) components.In 1964, IBM introduced System/360 computer architecture series computers capable running programs speed performance. This electronic computers incompatible another, manufacturer. To facilitate improvement, IBM utilized concept microprogram (often called "microcode"), sees widespread usage modern CPUs. The System/360 architecture popular dominated mainframe computer market decades left legacy continued modern computers IBM zSeries. In 1965, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) introduced influential computer aimed scientific markets, PDP-8.Transistor-based computers distinct advantages predecessors. Aside facilitating increased reliability lower power consumption, transistors allowed CPUs operate higher speeds short switching transistor comparison tube relay. The increased reliability dramatically increased speed switching elements (which exclusively transistors time), CPU clock rates tens megahertz easily period. Additionally discrete transistor IC CPUs heavy usage, high-performance designs SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) vector processors began appear. These experimental designs specialized supercomputers Cray Inc Fujitsu Ltd. Small-scale integration CPUs During period, method manufacturing interconnected transistors compact space developed. The integrated circuit (IC) allowed number transistors manufactured single semiconductor-based die, "chip". At basic non-specialized digital circuits NOR gates miniaturized ICs. CPUs based "building block" ICs generally referred "small-scale integration" (SSI) devices. SSI ICs, Apollo guidance computer, contained dozen transistors. To build entire CPU SSI ICs required thousands individual chips, consumed space power earlier discrete transistor designs.IBM's System/370 follow-on System/360 SSI ICs Solid Logic Technology discrete-transistor modules. DEC's PDP-8/I KI10 PDP-10 switched individual transistors PDP-8 PDP-10 SSI ICs, extremely popular PDP-11 originally built SSI ICs eventually implemented LSI components practical. Large-scale integration CPUs Lee Boysel published influential articles, including 1967 "manifesto", described build equivalent 32-bit mainframe computer small number large-scale integration circuits (LSI). At time, build LSI chips, chips gates, build MOS process (i.e., PMOS logic, NMOS logic, CMOS logic). However, companies continued build processors bipolar chips bipolar junction transistors faster MOS chips; example, Datapoint built processors transistor–transistor logic (TTL) chips 1980s.People building high-speed computers wanted fast, 1970s built CPUs small-scale integration (SSI) medium-scale integration (MSI) 7400 series TTL gates. At time, MOS ICs slow considered niche applications required power.As microelectronic technology advanced, increasing number transistors ICs, decreasing quantity individual ICs needed complete CPU. MSI LSI ICs increased transistor counts hundreds, thousands. By 1968, number ICs required build complete CPU reduced 24 ICs types, IC roughly 1000 MOSFETs. In stark contrast SSI MSI predecessors, LSI implementation PDP-11 contained CPU composed LSI integrated circuits. Microprocessors Since introduction commercially microprocessor, Intel 4004 1970, microprocessor, Intel 8080 1974, class CPUs completely overtaken central processing unit implementation methods. The 4004 origins "Busicom Project" dates 1968, figures 4004's creation including Busicom's Masatoshi Shima, Sharp's Tadashi Sasaki, Intel's Marcian Hoff Federico Faggin, fundamental inventions (Silicon Gate MOS ICs self-aligned gates random logic design methodology) implementation reality.Mainframe minicomputer manufacturers launched proprietary IC development programs upgrade older computer architectures, eventually produced instruction set compatible microprocessors backward-compatible older hardware software. Combined advent eventual ubiquitous personal computer, term CPU applied exclusively microprocessors. Several CPUs (denoted cores) combined single processing chip. Previous generations CPUs implemented discrete components numerous small integrated circuits (ICs) circuit boards. Microprocessors, hand, CPUs manufactured small number ICs; one. The smaller CPU size, implemented single die, faster switching physical factors decreased gate parasitic capacitance. This allowed synchronous microprocessors clock rates ranging tens megahertz gigahertz. Additionally, ability construct exceedingly small transistors IC increased complexity number transistors single CPU fold. This observed trend described Moore's law, proven fairly accurate predictor growth CPU (and IC) complexity.While complexity, size, construction, general CPUs changed enormously 1950, notable basic design function changed all. Almost common CPUs today accurately described von Neumann stored-program machines. As aforementioned Moore's law continues hold true, concerns arisen limits integrated circuit transistor technology. Extreme miniaturization electronic gates causing effects phenomena electromigration subthreshold leakage significant. These newer concerns factors causing researchers investigate methods computing quantum computer, well expand usage parallelism methods extend classical von Neumann model. Operation The fundamental operation CPUs, physical take, execute sequence stored instructions called program. The instructions executed kind computer memory. Nearly CPUs fetch, decode execute steps operation, collectively instruction cycle.After execution instruction, entire process repeats, instruction cycle fetching next-in-sequence instruction incremented program counter. If jump instruction executed, program counter modified address instruction jumped program execution continues normally. In complex CPUs, multiple instructions fetched, decoded, executed simultaneously. This describes generally referred "classic RISC pipeline", common simple CPUs electronic devices (often called microcontroller). It ignores role CPU cache, access stage pipeline.Some instructions manipulate program counter producing data directly; instructions generally called "jumps" facilitate program behavior loops, conditional program execution (through conditional jump), existence functions. In processors, instructions change bits "flags" register. These flags influence program behaves, indicate outcome operations. For example, processors "compare" instruction evaluates values sets clears bits flags register indicate greater equal; flags jump instruction determine program flow. Fetch The step, fetch, involves retrieving instruction (which represented number sequence numbers) program memory. The instruction's location (address) program memory determined program counter (PC), stores number identifies address instruction fetched. After instruction fetched, PC incremented length instruction address instruction sequence. Often, instruction fetched retrieved slow memory, causing CPU stall waiting instruction returned. This issue addressed modern processors caches pipeline architectures (see below). Decode The instruction CPU fetches memory determines CPU do. In decode step, performed circuitry instruction decoder, instruction converted signals control parts CPU.The instruction interpreted defined CPU's instruction set architecture (ISA). Often, group bits (that is, "field") instruction, called opcode, indicates operation performed, remaining fields supplemental required operation, operands. Those operands constant (called value), location processor register memory address, determined addressing mode.In CPU designs instruction decoder implemented hardwired, unchangeable circuit. In others, microprogram translate instructions sets CPU configuration signals applied sequentially multiple clock pulses. In cases memory stores microprogram rewritable, making change CPU decodes instructions. Execute After fetch decode steps, execute step performed. Depending CPU architecture, consist single action sequence actions. During action, parts CPU electrically connected perform desired operation action completed, typically response clock pulse. Very written internal CPU register access subsequent instructions. In cases written slower, expensive higher capacity memory.For example, addition instruction executed, arithmetic logic unit (ALU) inputs connected pair operand sources (numbers summed), ALU configured perform addition operation sum operand inputs appear output, ALU output connected storage (e.g., register memory) receive sum. When clock pulse occurs, sum transferred storage and, sum (i.e., larger ALU's output size), arithmetic overflow flag set. Structure implementation Hardwired CPU's circuitry set basic operations perform, called instruction set. Such operations involve, example, adding subtracting numbers, comparing numbers, jumping program. Each basic operation represented combination bits, machine language opcode; executing instructions machine language program, CPU decides operation perform "decoding" opcode. A complete machine language instruction consists opcode and, cases, additional bits arguments operation (for example, numbers summed case addition operation). Going complexity scale, machine language program collection machine language instructions CPU executes.The mathematical operation instruction performed combinational logic circuit CPU's processor arithmetic logic unit ALU. In general, CPU executes instruction fetching memory, ALU perform operation, storing memory. Beside instructions integer mathematics logic operations, machine instructions exist, loading data memory storing back, branching operations, mathematical operations floating-point numbers performed CPU's floating-point unit (FPU). Control unit The control unit CPU circuitry electrical signals direct entire computer system carry stored program instructions. The control unit execute program instructions; rather, directs parts system so. The control unit communicates ALU memory. Arithmetic logic unit The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) digital circuit processor performs integer arithmetic bitwise logic operations. The inputs ALU data operated (called operands), status operations, code control unit indicating operation perform. Depending instruction executed, operands internal CPU registers external memory, constants generated ALU itself.When input signals settled propagated ALU circuitry, performed operation appears ALU's outputs. The consists data word, stored register memory, status typically stored special, internal CPU register reserved purpose. Memory management unit Most high-end microprocessors (in desktop, laptop, server computers) memory management unit, translating logical addresses physical RAM addresses, providing memory protection paging abilities, virtual memory. Simpler processors, microcontrollers, include MMU. Clock rate Most CPUs synchronous circuits, employ clock signal pace sequential operations. The clock signal produced external oscillator circuit generates consistent number pulses second periodic square wave. The frequency clock pulses determines rate CPU executes instructions and, consequently, faster clock, instructions CPU execute second.To ensure proper operation CPU, clock period longer maximum needed signals propagate (move) CPU. In setting clock period well worst-case propagation delay, design entire CPU moves data "edges" rising falling clock signal. This advantage simplifying CPU significantly, design perspective component-count perspective. However, carries disadvantage entire CPU wait slowest elements, portions faster. This limitation compensated methods increasing CPU parallelism (see below).However, architectural improvements solve drawbacks globally synchronous CPUs. For example, clock signal subject delays electrical signal. Higher clock rates increasingly complex CPUs difficult clock signal phase (synchronized) entire unit. This led modern CPUs require multiple identical clock signals provided avoid delaying single signal CPU malfunction. Another major issue, clock rates increase dramatically, amount heat dissipated CPU. The constantly changing clock components switch time. In general, component switching energy element static state. Therefore, clock rate increases, energy consumption, causing CPU require heat dissipation CPU cooling solutions.One method dealing switching unneeded components called clock gating, involves turning clock signal unneeded components (effectively disabling them). However, regarded difficult implement common usage low-power designs. One notable CPU design extensive clock gating IBM PowerPC-based Xenon Xbox 360; way, power requirements Xbox 360 greatly reduced. Another method addressing problems global clock signal removal clock signal altogether. While removing global clock signal design process considerably complex ways, asynchronous (or clockless) designs carry marked advantages power consumption heat dissipation comparison synchronous designs. While uncommon, entire asynchronous CPUs built utilizing global clock signal. Two notable examples ARM compliant AMULET MIPS R3000 compatible MiniMIPS.Rather totally removing clock signal, CPU designs allow portions device asynchronous, asynchronous ALUs conjunction superscalar pipelining achieve arithmetic performance gains. While altogether clear totally asynchronous designs perform comparable better level synchronous counterparts, evident excel simpler math operations. This, combined excellent power consumption heat dissipation properties, suitable embedded computers. Integer range Every CPU represents numerical values way. For example, digital computers represented numbers familiar decimal (base 10) numeral system values, employed unusual representations ternary (base three). Nearly modern CPUs represent numbers binary form, digit represented two-valued physical quantity "high" "low" voltage.Related numeric representation size precision integer numbers CPU represent. In case binary CPU, measured number bits (significant digits binary encoded integer) CPU process operation, commonly called "word size", "bit width", "data path width", "integer precision", "integer size". A CPU's integer size determines range integer values directly operate on. For example, 8-bit CPU directly manipulate integers represented bits, range 256 (28) discrete integer values.Integer range number memory locations CPU directly address (an address integer representing memory location). For example, binary CPU 32 bits represent memory address directly address 232 memory locations. To circumvent limitation reasons, CPUs mechanisms (such bank switching) allow additional memory addressed.CPUs larger sizes require circuitry consequently physically larger, cost more, consume power (and generate heat). As result, smaller 4- 8-bit microcontrollers commonly modern applications CPUs larger sizes (such 16, 32, 64, 128-bit) available. When higher performance required, however, benefits larger size (larger data ranges address spaces) outweigh disadvantages. A CPU internal data paths shorter size reduce size cost. For example, IBM System/360 instruction set 32-bit instruction set, System/360 Model 30 Model 40 8-bit data paths arithmetic logical unit, 32-bit required cycles, 8 bits operands, and, Motorola 68k instruction set 32-bit instruction set, Motorola 68000 Motorola 68010 16-bit data paths arithmetic logical unit, 32-bit required cycles.To advantages afforded lower higher bit lengths, instruction sets bit widths integer floating-point data, allowing CPUs implementing instruction set bit widths portions device. For example, IBM System/360 instruction set 32 bit, supported 64-bit floating point values facilitate greater accuracy range floating point numbers. The System/360 Model 65 8-bit adder decimal fixed-point binary arithmetic 60-bit adder floating-point arithmetic. Many CPU designs mixed bit width, processor general-purpose usage reasonable balance integer floating point capability required. Parallelism The description basic operation CPU offered describes simplest CPU take. This type CPU, referred subscalar, operates executes instruction pieces data time, instruction clock cycle (IPC < 1).This process inherent inefficiency subscalar CPUs. Since instruction executed time, entire CPU wait instruction complete proceeding instruction. As result, subscalar CPU "hung up" instructions clock cycle complete execution. Even adding second execution unit (see below) improve performance much; pathway hung up, pathways hung number unused transistors increased. This design, CPU's execution resources operate instruction time, reach scalar performance (one instruction clock cycle, IPC 1). However, performance subscalar (less instruction clock cycle, IPC < 1).Attempts achieve scalar better performance variety design methodologies CPU behave linearly parallel. When referring parallelism CPUs, terms generally classify design techniques:instruction-level parallelism (ILP), seeks increase rate instructions executed CPU (that is, increase utilization on-die execution resources);task-level parallelism (TLP), purposes increase number threads processes CPU execute simultaneously.Each methodology differs implemented, well effectiveness afford increasing CPU's performance application. Instruction-level parallelism One simplest methods accomplish increased parallelism steps instruction fetching decoding prior instruction finishes executing. This simplest technique instruction pipelining, utilized modern general-purpose CPUs. Pipelining allows instruction executed breaking execution pathway discrete stages. This separation compared assembly line, instruction complete stage exits execution pipeline retired.Pipelining does, however, introduce possibility situation operation needed complete operation; condition termed data dependency conflict. To cope this, additional care check sorts conditions delay portion instruction pipeline occurs. Naturally, accomplishing requires additional circuitry, pipelined processors complex subscalar (though so). A pipelined processor scalar, inhibited pipeline stalls (an instruction spending clock cycle stage).Further improvement idea instruction pipelining led development method decreases idle CPU components further. Designs superscalar include instruction pipeline multiple identical execution units. In superscalar pipeline, multiple instructions passed dispatcher, decides instructions executed parallel (simultaneously). If dispatched execution units, ability instructions executed simultaneously. In general, instructions superscalar CPU dispatch simultaneously waiting execution units, instructions completed cycle.Most difficulty design superscalar CPU architecture lies creating effective dispatcher. The dispatcher correctly determine instructions executed parallel, well dispatch execution units busy possible. This requires instruction pipeline filled superscalar architectures amounts CPU cache. It hazard-avoiding techniques branch prediction, speculative execution, out-of-order execution crucial maintaining high levels performance. By attempting predict branch (or path) conditional instruction take, CPU minimize number entire pipeline wait conditional instruction completed. Speculative execution modest performance increases executing portions code needed conditional operation completes. Out-of-order execution rearranges order instructions executed reduce delays data dependencies. Also case single instruction stream, multiple data stream—a case lot data type processed—, modern processors disable parts pipeline single instruction executed times, CPU skips fetch decode phases greatly increases performance occasions, highly monotonous program engines video creation software photo processing.In case portion CPU superscalar not, suffers performance penalty scheduling stalls. The Intel P5 Pentium superscalar ALUs accept instruction clock cycle each, FPU accept instruction clock cycle. Thus P5 integer superscalar floating point superscalar. Intel's successor P5 architecture, P6, superscalar capabilities floating point features, afforded increase floating point instruction performance.Both simple pipelining superscalar design increase CPU's ILP allowing single processor complete execution instructions rates surpassing instruction clock cycle. Most modern CPU designs superscalar, general purpose CPUs designed decade superscalar. In years emphasis designing high-ILP computers moved CPU's hardware software interface, ISA. The strategy instruction (VLIW) ILP implied directly software, reducing amount work CPU perform boost ILP reducing design's complexity. Task-level parallelism Another strategy achieving performance execute multiple threads processes parallel. This area parallel computing. In Flynn's taxonomy, strategy multiple instruction stream, multiple data stream (MIMD).One technology purpose multiprocessing (MP). The initial flavor technology symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), small number CPUs share coherent view memory system. In scheme, CPU additional hardware maintain constantly up-to-date view memory. By avoiding stale views memory, CPUs cooperate program programs migrate CPU another. To increase number cooperating CPUs handful, schemes non-uniform memory access (NUMA) directory-based coherence protocols introduced 1990s. SMP systems limited small number CPUs NUMA systems built thousands processors. Initially, multiprocessing built multiple discrete CPUs boards implement interconnect processors. When processors interconnect implemented single chip, technology chip-level multiprocessing (CMP) single chip multi-core processor.It recognized finer-grain parallelism existed single program. A single program threads (or functions) executed separately parallel. Some earliest examples technology implemented input/output processing direct memory access separate thread computation thread. A general approach technology introduced 1970s systems designed multiple computation threads parallel. This technology multi-threading (MT). This approach considered cost-effective multiprocessing, small number components CPU replicated support MT opposed entire CPU case MP. In MT, execution units memory system including caches shared multiple threads. The downside MT hardware support multithreading visible software MP supervisor software operating systems undergo larger changes support MT. One type MT implemented temporal multithreading, thread executed stalled waiting data return external memory. In scheme, CPU context switch thread run, switch CPU clock cycle, UltraSPARC T1. Another type MT simultaneous multithreading, instructions multiple threads executed parallel CPU clock cycle.For decades 1970s 2000s, focus designing high performance general purpose CPUs achieving high ILP technologies pipelining, caches, superscalar execution, out-of-order execution, etc. This trend culminated large, power-hungry CPUs Intel Pentium 4. By 2000s, CPU designers thwarted achieving higher performance ILP techniques growing disparity CPU operating frequencies memory operating frequencies well escalating CPU power dissipation esoteric ILP techniques.CPU designers borrowed ideas commercial computing markets transaction processing, aggregate performance multiple programs, throughput computing, performance single thread process.This reversal emphasis evidenced proliferation dual core processor designs notably, Intel's newer designs resembling superscalar P6 architecture. Late designs processor families exhibit CMP, including x86-64 Opteron Athlon 64 X2, SPARC UltraSPARC T1, IBM POWER4 POWER5, well video game console CPUs Xbox 360's triple-core PowerPC design, PS3's 7-core Cell microprocessor. Data parallelism A common increasingly paradigm processors (and indeed, computing general) deals data parallelism. The processors discussed earlier referred type scalar device. As implies, vector processors deal multiple pieces data context instruction. This contrasts scalar processors, deal piece data instruction. Using Flynn's taxonomy, schemes dealing data generally referred single instruction stream, multiple data stream (SIMD) single instruction stream, single data stream (SISD), respectively. The great utility creating processors deal vectors data lies optimizing tasks require operation (for example, sum dot product) performed set data. Some classic examples types tasks include multimedia applications (images, video, sound), well types scientific engineering tasks. Whereas scalar processor complete entire process fetching, decoding, executing instruction set data, vector processor perform single operation comparatively set data instruction. Of course, application require steps apply operation set data.Most vector processors, Cray-1, associated exclusively scientific cryptography applications. However, multimedia shifted digital media, SIMD general-purpose processors significant. Shortly inclusion floating-point units started commonplace general-purpose processors, specifications implementations SIMD execution units began appear general-purpose processors. Some SIMD specifications HP's Multimedia Acceleration eXtensions (MAX) Intel's MMX integer-only. This proved impediment software developers, applications benefit SIMD deal floating-point numbers. Progressively, developers refined remade designs common modern SIMD specifications, associated ISA. Some notable modern examples include Intel's SSE PowerPC-related AltiVec (also VMX). Virtual CPUs Cloud computing involve subdividing CPU operation virtual central processing units (vCPUs).A host virtual equivalent physical machine, virtual system operating. When physical machines operating tandem managed whole, grouped computing memory resources cluster. In systems dynamically remove cluster. Resources host cluster level partitioned resources pools fine granularity. Performance The performance speed processor depends on, factors, clock rate (generally multiples hertz) instructions clock (IPC), factors instructions second (IPS) CPU perform. Many reported IPS values represented "peak" execution rates artificial instruction sequences branches, realistic workloads consist mix instructions applications, longer execute others. The performance memory hierarchy greatly processor performance, issue barely considered MIPS calculations. Because problems, standardized tests, called "benchmarks" purpose‍—‌such SPECint‍—‌have developed attempt measure effective performance commonly applications.Processing performance computers increased multi-core processors, essentially plugging individual processors (called cores sense) integrated circuit. Ideally, dual core processor powerful single core processor. In practice, performance smaller, 50%, imperfect software algorithms implementation. Increasing number cores processor (i.e. dual-core, quad-core, etc.) increases workload handled. This processor handle numerous asynchronous events, interrupts, etc. toll CPU overwhelmed. These cores thought floors processing plant, floor handling task. Sometimes, cores handle tasks cores adjacent single core handle information.Due capabilities modern CPUs, hyper-threading uncore, involve sharing CPU resources aiming increased utilization, monitoring performance levels hardware utilization gradually complex task. As response, CPUs implement additional hardware logic monitors utilization parts CPU counters accessible software; example Intel's Performance Counter Monitor technology.

Baseball game clock, games ninth inning.Baseball evolved older bat-and-ball games played England mid-18th century. This game brought immigrants North America, modern version developed. By 19th century, baseball recognized national sport United States. Baseball currently popular North America parts Central South America, Caribbean, East Asia, Japan.In United States Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams divided National League (NL) American League (AL), three divisions: East, West, Central. The major league champion determined playoffs culminate World Series. The level play split Japan Central Pacific Leagues Cuba West League East League. History Origins The evolution baseball older bat-and-ball games difficult trace precision. A French manuscript 1344 illustration clerics playing game, soule, similarities baseball. Other French games thèque, balle bâton, balle empoisonnée appear related. Consensus held today's baseball North American development older game rounders, popular Great Britain Ireland. Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search Roots Game (2005), David Block, suggests game originated England; uncovered historical evidence supports position. Block argues rounders baseball regional variants other, game's direct antecedents English games stoolball "tut-ball." It believed cricket descended games, evidence uncovered 2009 suggests cricket imported England Flanders.The earliest reference baseball 1744 British publication, A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, John Newbery. It rhymed description "base-ball" woodcut field set-up modern game—though triangular diamond configuration, posts ground-level bases. David Block discovered recorded game "Bass-Ball" 1749 Surrey, featured Prince Wales player. William Bray, English lawyer, recorded game baseball Easter Monday 1755 Guildford, Surrey. This game brought Canada English immigrants. Rounders brought USA Canadians British Irish ancestry. The American reference baseball appears 1791 Pittsfield, Massachusetts, town bylaw prohibiting playing game town's meeting house. By 1796, version game well-known earn mention German scholar's book popular pastimes. As described Johann Gutsmuths, "englische Base-ball" involved contest teams, "the batter three attempts ball plate." Only required retire side.By 1830s, reports variety uncodified bat-and-ball games recognizable forms baseball played North America. These games referred locally "town ball", names "round-ball" "base-ball" used. Among earliest examples receive detailed description—albeit decades fact, letter attendee Sporting Life magazine—took Beachville, Ontario, 1838. There similarities modern baseball, crucial differences: bases (or byes); bye 18 feet (5.5 m) bye; batter ball caught bounce. The accepted story Abner Doubleday invented baseball Cooperstown, New York, 1839 conclusively debunked sports historians.In 1845, Alexander Cartwright, member New York City's Knickerbocker Club, led codification so-called Knickerbocker Rules. The practice, common bat-and-ball games day, "soaking" "plugging"—effecting putout hitting runner thrown ball—was barred. The rules facilitated smaller, harder ball common. Several rules brought Knickerbockers' game close modern one, ball caught bounce was, again, underhand pitching allowed. While reports New York Knickerbockers played games 1845, contest recognized officially recorded baseball game U.S. history June 19, 1846, Hoboken, New Jersey: "New York Nine" defeated Knickerbockers, 23–1, (three earlier games discovered). With Knickerbocker code basis, rules modern baseball continued evolve half-century. History baseball United States The game turns professional In mid-1850s, baseball craze New York metropolitan area. By 1856, local journals referring baseball "national pastime" "national game." A year later, sixteen area clubs formed sport's governing body, National Association Base Ball Players. In 1858 Corona, Queens New York, Fashion Race Course, games baseball charge admission place. The games, stars Brooklyn, including players Brooklyn Atlantics, Excelsior Brooklyn, Putnams Eckford Brooklyn, All Stars New York (Manhattan), including players New York Knickerbockers, Gothams (predecessors San Francisco Giants), Eagles Empire, commonly believed all-star baseball games. In 1863, organization disallowed putouts catching fair ball bounce. Four years later, barred participation African Americans. The game's commercial developing: 1869 professional baseball club, Cincinnati Red Stockings, formed undefeated schedule semipro amateur teams. The professional league, National Association Professional Base Ball Players, lasted 1871 1875; scholars dispute status major league.The formally structured National League founded 1876. As oldest surviving major league, National League referred "senior circuit." Several major leagues formed failed. In 1884, African American Moses Walker (and, briefly, brother Welday) played these, American Association. An injury ended Walker's major league career, 1890s, gentlemen's agreement baseball color effectively barred black players white-owned professional leagues, major minor. Professional Negro leagues formed, folded. Several independent African American teams succeeded barnstormers. Also 1884, overhand pitching legalized. In 1887, softball, indoor baseball indoor-outdoor, invented winter version game. Virtually modern baseball rules 1893; major change—counting foul balls strikes—was instituted 1901. The National League's counterpart, American League, evolved minor Western League, established year. The leagues, teams, rivals fought best players, disregarding other's contracts engaging bitter legal disputes.A modicum peace eventually established, leading National Agreement 1903. The pact formalized relations major leagues National Association Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing country's minor professional leagues. The World Series, pitting major league champions other, inaugurated fall, albeit express major league sanction: The Boston Americans American League defeated Pittsburgh Pirates National League. The year, series held, National League champion New York Giants, manager John McGraw, refused recognize major league status American League champion. In 1905, Giants National League champions team management relented, leading establishment World Series major leagues' annual championship event.As professional baseball increasingly profitable, players frequently raised grievances owners issues control equitable income distribution. During major leagues' decades, players teams occasionally attempted strikes, routinely failed jobs threatened. In general, strict rules baseball contracts reserve clause, bound players teams contracts ended, tended players check. Motivated dislike stingy owner Charles Comiskey gamblers' payoffs, promised, members Chicago White Sox conspired throw 1919 World Series. The Black Sox Scandal led National Commission baseball drew major leagues closer together. The major league baseball commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, elected 1920. That year founding Negro National League; Negro league, operate 1931. For 1920s, joined Eastern Colored League.Professional baseball played northeastern cities immigrant-ethnic population; support sport. The Irish Catholics dominated 19th century, comprising third players stars managers. Historian Jerrold Casway argues that:Baseball Irish kids shortcut American dream self-indulgent glory fortune. By mid-1880s young Irish men dominated sport popularized style play termed heady, daring, spontaneous.... Ed Delahanty personified flamboyant, exciting spectator-favorite, Casey-at-the-bat, Irish slugger. The handsome masculine athlete expected live played. Rise Ruth racial integration Compared present, professional baseball 20th century lower-scoring pitchers, likes Walter Johnson Christy Mathewson, dominant. The "inside game," demanded players "scratch runs", played aggressively today: brilliant violent Ty Cobb epitomized style. The so-called dead-ball ended 1920s changes rule circumstance advantageous hitters. Strict regulations governing ball's size, shape composition rule officially banning spitball, pitches depended ball treated roughed-up foreign substances death Ray Chapman pitch August 1920, coupled superior materials World War I, ball traveled farther hit. The construction additional seating accommodate rising popularity game bringing outfield fences closer in, making runs common. The legendary player Babe Ruth, great power hitter era, helped permanently alter nature game. The club Ruth set slugging records, New York Yankees, built reputation majors' premier team. In 1920s 1930s, St. Louis Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey invested minor league clubs developed modern "farm system". A Negro National League organized 1933; years later, joined Negro American League. The elections Baseball Hall Fame 1936. In 1939 Little League Baseball founded Pennsylvania. By 1940s, organizing children's baseball leagues United States.With America's entry World War II, professional players left serve armed forces. A number minor league teams disbanded major league game threat well. Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley led professional league women players help game public eye – All-American Girls Professional Baseball League existed 1943 1954. The inaugural College World Series held 1947, Babe Ruth League youth program founded. This program organizing children's baseball. The crack unwritten agreement barring blacks white-controlled professional ball occurred year: Jackie Robinson signed National League's Brooklyn Dodgers—where Branch Rickey general manager—and began playing minor league team Montreal. In 1947, Robinson broke major leagues' color barrier debuted Dodgers. Larry Doby debuted American League's Cleveland Indians year. Latin American players, overlooked before, started entering majors greater numbers. In 1951, Chicago White Sox, Venezuelan-born Chico Carrasquel black Cuban-born Minnie Miñoso, Hispanic All-Stars.Facing competition varied television football, baseball attendance levels declined. While majors rebounded mid-1950s, minor leagues gutted hundreds semipro amateur teams dissolved. Integration proceeded slowly: 1953, 16 major league teams black player roster. That year, Major League Baseball Players Association founded. It professional baseball union survive briefly, remained ineffective years. No major league team located west St. Louis 1958, Brooklyn Dodgers New York Giants relocated Los Angeles San Francisco, respectively. The majors' final all-white bastion, Boston Red Sox, black player 1959. With integration majors drying pool players, Negro league folded year. In 1961, American League reached West Coast Los Angeles Angels expansion team, major league season extended 154 games 162. This coincidentally helped Roger Maris break Babe Ruth's long-standing single-season record, celebrated marks baseball. Along Angels, three franchises launched 1961–62. With this, major league expansion 60 years, league teams. Attendance records steroids The players' union bolder leadership United Steelworkers chief economist negotiator Marvin Miller, elected executive director 1966. On playing field, major league pitchers increasingly again. After 1968 season, effort restore balance, strike zone reduced height pitcher's mound lowered 15 10 inches (38.1 25.4 cm) . In 1969, National American leagues expansion teams, leagues reorganized divisions each, post-season playoff system leading World Series instituted. Also year, Curt Flood St. Louis Cardinals serious legal challenge reserve clause. The major leagues' general players' strike 1972. In effort offense game, American League designated hitter rule year. In 1975, union's power—and players' salaries—began increase greatly reserve clause effectively struck down, leading free agency system. In 1977, expansion teams joined American League. Significant work stoppages occurred 1981 1994, forcing cancellation World Series 90 years. Attendance growing steadily mid-1970s 1994, stoppage, majors setting all-time record per-game attendance.The addition expansion teams 1993 season facilitated restructuring major leagues, three divisions each. Offensive production—the number runs particular—had surged year, abbreviated 1994 season. After play resumed 1995, trend continued non-division-winning wild card teams permanent fixture post-season. Regular-season interleague play introduced 1997 second-highest attendance mark season set. The year, Mark McGwire Sammy Sosa surpassed Maris's decades-old single season record expansion franchises added. In 2000, National American leagues dissolved legal entities. While identities maintained scheduling purposes (and designated hitter distinction), regulations functions—such player discipline umpire supervision—they administered separately consolidated rubric Major League Baseball (MLB).In 2001, Barry Bonds established current record 73 runs single season. There suspicions dramatic increase power hitting fueled abuse illegal steroids (as well dilution pitching talent expansion), issue began attracting attention 2002 penalty performance-enhancing drugs 2004. In 2007, Bonds MLB's all-time leader, surpassing Hank Aaron, total major league minor league attendance reached all-time highs. Even McGwire, Sosa, Bonds—as well players, including storied pitcher Roger Clemens—have implicated steroid abuse scandal, feats sluggers major leagues' defining attraction. In contrast professional game's resurgence popularity 1994 interruption, Little League enrollment decline: peaking 1996, dropped 1 percent year decade. With rigorous testing penalties performance-enhancing drug factor, balance bat ball swung markedly 2010, "Year Pitcher". Runs game fell lowest level 18 years, strikeout rate higher half century.Before start 2012 season, MLB altered rules double number wild card teams admitted playoffs league. The playoff expansion addition annual one-game playoffs wild card teams league. Baseball Baseball, America's pastime, well established countries well. The history baseball Canada remained closely linked sport United States. As 1877, professional league, International Association, featured teams countries. While baseball played Canada minor league teams based country, American major leagues include Canadian club 1969, Montreal Expos joined National League expansion team. In 1977, expansion Toronto Blue Jays joined American League. The Blue Jays World Series 1992 1993, club United States so. After 2004 season, Major League Baseball relocated Expos Washington, D.C., team Nationals.In 1847, American soldiers played baseball game Mexico Parque Los Berros Xalapa, Veracruz. A days Battle Cerro Gordo, "wooden leg captured (by Fourth Illinois regiment) General Santa Anna". The formal baseball league United States Canada founded 1878 Cuba, maintains rich baseball tradition national team world's strongest international play began 1930s (all organized baseball country officially amateur Cuban Revolution). The Dominican Republic held islandwide championship tournament 1912. Professional baseball tournaments leagues began countries wars, including Netherlands (formed 1922), Australia (1934), Japan (1936), Mexico (1937), Puerto Rico (1938). The Japanese major leagues—the Central League Pacific League—have considered highest quality professional circuits United States. Japan professional minor league system well, smaller American version—each team farm club contrast MLB teams' five.After World War II, professional leagues founded Latin American nations, prominently Venezuela (1946) Dominican Republic (1955). Since 1970s, annual Caribbean Series matched championship clubs leading Latin American winter leagues: Dominican Professional Baseball League, Mexican Pacific League, Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League, Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. In Asia, South Korea (1982), Taiwan (1990), China (2003) professional leagues.Many European countries professional leagues well, successful, Dutch league, Italian league founded 1948. Compared Asia Latin America, European leagues Australia historically niche appeal. In 2004, Australia surprise silver medal Olympic Games. The Israel Baseball League, launched 2007, folded season. The Confédération Européene Baseball (European Baseball Confederation), founded 1953, organizes number competitions clubs countries, well national squads. Other competitions national teams, Baseball World Cup Olympic baseball tournament, administered International Baseball Federation (IBAF) 1938 2013 merger International Softball Federation create current joint governing sports, World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC). By 2009, IBAF 117 member countries. Women's baseball played organized amateur basis countries leading men's sport. Since 2004, IBAF WBSC sanctioned Women's Baseball World Cup, featuring national teams.After admitted Olympics medal sport 1992 Games, baseball dropped 2012 Summer Olympic Games 2005 International Olympic Committee meeting. It remained 2008 Games. The elimination baseball, softball, 2012 Olympic program enabled IOC consider adding sports, received votes required inclusion. While sport's lack factor, Major League Baseball's reluctance break Games allow players participate, National Hockey League Winter Olympic Games. Such break difficult MLB accommodate force playoffs deeper cold weather. Seeking reinstatement 2016 Summer Olympics, IBAF proposed abbreviated competition designed facilitate participation players, effort failed. Major League Baseball initiated World Baseball Classic, scheduled precede major league season, partly replacement, high-profile international tournament. The inaugural Classic, held March 2006, tournament involving national teams feature number MLB participants. The Baseball World Cup discontinued 2011 edition favor expanded World Baseball Classic. Rules gameplay A game played teams, composed players, turns playing offense (batting baserunning) defense (pitching fielding). A pair turns, bat field, team constitutes inning. A game consists (seven high school level doubleheaders college minor leagues). One team—customarily visiting team—bats top, half, inning. The team—customarily team—bats bottom, second half, inning. The goal game score points (runs) team. The players team bat attempt score runs circling completing tour bases set corners square-shaped baseball diamond. A player bats plate proceed counterclockwise base, second base, third base, order score run. The team field attempts prevent runs scoring record outs, remove opposing players offensive action turn team's batting order again. When three recorded, teams switch roles half-inning. If score game tied innings, extra played resolve contest. Many amateur games, unorganized ones, involve numbers players innings.The game played field primary boundaries, foul lines, extend forward plate 45-degree angles. The 90-degree area foul lines referred fair territory; 270-degree area foul territory. The field enclosed bases yards infield; area farther infield outfield. In middle infield raised pitcher's mound, rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) center. The outer boundary outfield typically demarcated raised fence, material height (many amateur games played unfenced fields). Fair territory plate outfield boundary baseball's field play, events foul territory, well.There three basic tools baseball: ball, bat, glove mitt:The baseball size adult's fist, 9 inches (23 centimeters) circumference. It rubber cork center, wound yarn covered white cowhide, stitching.The bat hitting tool, traditionally single, solid piece wood. Other materials commonly nonprofessional games. It stick, 2.5 inches (6.4 centimeters) diameter hitting end, tapering narrower handle culminating knob. Bats adults typically 34 inches (86 centimeters) long, longer 42 inches (106 centimeters).The glove fielding tool, padded leather webbing fingers. As catching holding ball, takes shapes meet fielding positions.Protective helmets standard equipment batters.At half-inning, players fielding team arrange field. One them, pitcher, stands pitcher's mound. The pitcher pitching delivery foot rubber, pushing velocity throwing plate. Another player, catcher, squats plate, facing pitcher. The rest team faces plate, typically arranged infielders—who set yards imaginary lines first, second, third base—and three outfielders. In standard arrangement, baseman positioned steps left base, second baseman second base, shortstop left second base, third baseman third base. The basic outfield positions left fielder, center fielder, fielder. A neutral umpire sets catcher. Other umpires distributed field well, number vary depending level play, amateur children's games umpire plate, umpires Major League Baseball games.Play starts batter standing plate, holding bat. The batter waits pitcher throw pitch (the ball) plate, attempts ball bat. The catcher catches pitches batter hit—as electing swing failing connect—and returns pitcher. A batter hits ball field play drop bat running base, point player referred runner (or, play over, batter-runner). A batter-runner reaches base (see below) safe base. A batter-runner choose remain base attempt advance second base beyond—however player believes reached safely. A player reaches base despite proper play fielders recorded hit. A player reaches base safely credited single. If player second base safely direct hit, double; third base, triple. If ball air foul lines entire outfield (and outfield fence, one), run: batter runners base freely circle bases, scoring run. This desirable batter. A player reaches base fielding mistake credited hit—instead, responsible fielder charged error.Any runners base attempt advance batted balls land, contact ground, fair territory, ball lands. A runner base attempt advance ball lands play. If ball play rolls foul passing infield, dead runners return base play began. If ball air caught lands, batter flied runners base attempt advance tag touch base play began, ball caught. Runners attempt advance base pitcher process delivering ball plate—a effort stolen base.A pitch field play called strike ball. A batter three strikes recorded strikes out. A batter balls recorded awarded base balls walk, free advance base. (A batter freely advance base batter's uniform struck pitch strike zone, provided batter swing attempts avoid hit.) Crucial determining balls strikes umpire's judgment pitch passed strike zone, conceptual area plate extending midpoint batter's shoulders belt hollow knee.A strike called happens:The batter well-pitched ball (one strike zone) catcher.The batter swings ball (even strike zone) misses, foul tips directly catcher's hands.The batter hits foul ball—one initially lands foul territory initially lands diamond moves foul territory passing third base. If strikes batter, foul ball counted third strike; thus, foul ball strikeout batter. (There exception exception: two-strike foul bunt recorded third strike.)A ball called pitcher throws pitch strike zone, provided batter swung it.While team bat score runs, team field attempting record outs. Among member batting team out, common:The strikeout: described above, recorded batter three strikes putting ball play awarded free advance base (see uncaught third strike).The flyout: described above, recorded batter hits ball air caught fielder, fair territory foul territory, lands, batter run.The ground out: recorded batter (in case, batter-runner) hits ball lands fair territory which, batter-runner reach base, retrieved fielder touches base holding ball relays fielder touches base holding ball.The force out: recorded runner required attempt advance—either runner base batted ball lands fair territory, runner basepath required attempt advance—but fails reach base fielder touches base holding ball. The ground technically case force out.The tag out: recorded runner touched fielder ball glove holding ball, runner touching base.It record course play. This called double play. Even three play, triple play, possible, rare. Players retired leave field, returning team's dugout bench. A runner stranded base third recorded player team. Stranded runners benefit team turn bat half-inning bases empty runners.An individual player's turn batting plate appearance complete player reaches base, hits run, out, hits ball team's third out, recorded teammate. On rare occasions, batter plate when, batter's hitting ball, third recorded teammate—for instance, runner caught stealing (tagged attempting steal base). A batter sort incomplete plate appearance starts team's turn batting; balls strikes recorded batter erased. A runner circle bases plate appearance score single batting turn. Once player completed plate appearance, player bat members player's team turn bat. The batting order set game begins, altered substitutions. Once player removed substitute, player reenter game. Children's games liberal substitution rules.If designated hitter (DH) rule effect, team tenth player sole responsibility bat (and run). The DH takes player—almost invariably pitcher—in batting order, field. Thus, DH, team batting order players fielding arrangement players. Personnel Player rosters Roster, squad, sizes leagues levels organized play. Major League Baseball teams maintain 25-player active rosters. A typical 25-man roster league DH rule, MLB's National League, features:eight position players—catcher, infielders, three outfielders—who play regular basisfive starting pitchers constitute team's pitching rotation starting rotationsix relief pitchers, including specialist closer, constitute team's bullpen (named off-field area pitchers warm up)one backup, substitute, catchertwo backup infielderstwo backup outfieldersone specialist pinch hitter, second backup catcher, seventh relieverIn American League DH rule, offensive regulars (including DH), starting pitchers, relievers, backup catcher three reserves; pinch-hitters (usually pitcher's spot) reduced DH. Other personnel The manager, head coach team, oversees team's major strategic decisions, establishing starting rotation, setting lineup, batting order, game, making substitutions games—in particular, bringing relief pitchers. Managers typically assisted coaches; specialized responsibilities, working players hitting, fielding, pitching, strength conditioning. At levels organized play, coaches stationed field team bat: base coach third base coach, occupying designated coaches' boxes foul lines, assist direction baserunners ball play, relay tactical signals manager batters runners pauses play. In contrast team sports, baseball managers coaches generally wear team's uniforms; coaches uniform order allowed playing field game.Any baseball game involves umpires, rulings outcome play. At minimum, umpire stand catcher, good view strike zone, balls strikes. Additional umpires stationed bases, making easier judge plays attempted force tag outs. In Major League Baseball, umpires game, base. In playoffs, umpires used: base outfield foul lines. Strategy tactics Many pre-game in-game strategic decisions baseball revolve fundamental fact: general, right-handed batters left-handed pitchers and, greater degree, left-handed batters right-handed pitchers. A manager left-handed batters regular lineup team facing left-handed starting pitcher respond starting right-handed backups team's roster. During game, relief pitchers pinch hitters brought in, opposing managers create favorable matchups substitutions: manager fielding team arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups, manager batting team arrange opposite-handed matchups. With team lead innings, manager remove starting position player—especially turn bat again—for skillful fielder. Pitching fielding tactics The tactical decision precedes play baseball game involves pitch selection. By gripping releasing baseball manner, throwing speed, pitchers baseball break side, downward, approaches batter. Among variety pitches thrown, basic types fastball, changeup (or off-speed pitch), breaking balls—the curveball slider. Pitchers repertoires pitches skillful throwing. Conventionally, pitch, catcher signals pitcher type pitch throw, well general vertical and/or horizontal location. If disagreement selection, pitcher shake catcher pitch. With runner base lead, pitcher attempt pickoff, throw fielder covering base runner's lead check or, optimally, tag out. Pickoff attempts, however, subject rules severely restrict pitcher's movements pickoff attempt. Violation rules umpire calling balk pitcher, runners base, any, advance base impunity. If attempted stolen base anticipated, catcher pitchout, ball thrown deliberately plate, allowing catcher catch standing throw base. Facing batter tendency field, fielding team employ shift, fielders moving left positions. With runner third base, infielders play in, moving closer plate improve odds throwing runner ground ball, sharply grounder carry drawn-in infield. Batting baserunning tactics Several basic offensive tactics play runner base, including fundamental choice attempt steal second base. The employed skillful contact hitter: runner takes pitch drawing shortstop second baseman second base, creating gap infield batter poke ball through. The sacrifice bunt calls batter focus making contact ball rolls short distance infield, allowing runner advance scoring position expense batter thrown first—a batter succeeds credited sacrifice. (A batter, fast runner, attempt bunt hit.) A sacrifice bunt employed runner third base, aimed bringing runner home, squeeze play. With runner third fewer outs, batter concentrate hitting ball that, caught, deep allow runner tag score—a batter case credit sacrifice fly. The manager signal batter ahead count (i.e., balls strikes) take, swing at, pitch. Distinctive elements Baseball attributes set apart popular team sports countries following, including American Canadian football, basketball, hockey, soccer. All sports clock; them, play individual collective; variation playing fields important. The comparison cricket baseball demonstrates baseball's distinctive elements shared cousin sports. No clock kill In clock-limited sports, games team holds lead killing clock competing aggressively opposing team. In contrast, baseball clock; team batter rallies constrained time. At turn baseball game, advantageous strategy aggressive strategy. In contrast, again, clock play case multi-day Test first-class cricket: possibility draw encourages team batting well bat defensively, faint chance avoid loss. Baseball offers reward conservative batting.While standard professional baseball, duration average major league game increased steadily years. At turn 20th century, games typically hour half play. In 1920s, averaged hours, eventually ballooned 2:38 1960. By 1997, average American League game lasted 2:57 (National League games 10 minutes shorter—pitchers plate making quicker designated hitters). In 2004, Major League Baseball declared goal average game 2:45. By 2014, though, average MLB game three hours complete. The lengthening games attributed longer breaks half-innings television commercials, increased offense, pitching changes, slower pace play pitchers delivery, batters stepping box frequently. Other leagues experienced issues. In 2008, Nippon Professional Baseball steps aimed shortening games 12 minutes preceding decade's average 3:18. Individual focus Although baseball team sport, individual players scrutiny pressure. In 1915, baseball instructional manual pointed single pitch, game, involves individual, one-on-one contest: "the pitcher batter battle wits". Contrasting game football basketball, scholar Michael Mandelbaum argues "baseball closest evolutionary descent older individual sports". Pitcher, batter, fielder essentially independent other. While coaching staffs signal pitcher batter pursue tactics, execution play series solitary acts. If batter hits drive, outfielder solely responsible deciding catch play bounce succeeding failing. The statistical precision baseball facilitated isolation reinforces it. As described Mandelbaum,It impossible isolate objectively assess contribution [football] team member outcome play ... [E]very basketball player interacting teammates time. In baseball, contrast, player ... Baseball realm complete transparency total responsibility. A baseball player lives glass house, stark moral universe ... Everything player accounted accounted good bad, wrong.Cricket baseball team sports regard: individual focus cricket mitigated batting partnership practicalities tandem running, enhanced fact batsman occupy wicket hour more. There statistical equivalent cricket fielding error emphasis personal responsibility area play. Uniqueness baseball park Unlike sports, baseball playing fields vary size shape. While dimensions infield regulated, constraint outfield size shape professional teams rules Major League Minor League Baseball fields built remodeled June 1, 1958, minimum distance 325 feet (99 m) plate fences left field 400 feet (122 m) center. Major league teams skirt rule. For example, Minute Maid Park, Houston Astros 2000, Crawford Boxes left field 315 feet (96 m) plate. There rules address height fences structures edge outfield. The famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary left-field wall Boston's Fenway Park, 1912: Green Monster 310 feet (94 m) plate 37 feet (11 m) tall.Similarly, regulations concerning dimensions foul territory. Thus foul ball entirely play park space foul lines stands, foulout park expansive foul ground. A fence foul territory close outfield direct balls strike fielders, farther collisions, outfielders speed field balls deep corner. These variations difference double triple inside-the-park run. The surface field unregulated. While adjacent image traditional field surfacing arrangement (and virtually MLB teams naturally surfaced fields), teams free decide areas grassed bare. Some fields—including MLB—use artificial surface, AstroTurf. Surface variations ground balls behave fielded well baserunning. Similarly, presence roof (seven major league teams play stadiums permanent retractable roofs) greatly balls played. While football soccer players deal variations field surface stadium covering, size shape fields standardized. The area out-of-bounds football soccer field play foul territory baseball does, variations insignificant.These physical variations create distinctive set playing conditions ballpark. Other local factors, altitude climate, play. A stadium acquire reputation pitcher's park hitter's park, discipline notably benefits unique mix elements. The exceptional park Coors Field, Colorado Rockies. Its high altitude—5,282 feet (1,610 m) level—is responsible strongest hitter's park major leagues. Wrigley Field, Chicago Cubs, fickle disposition: hitter's park winds Lake Michigan blowing out, pitcher's park blowing in. The absence standardized field games play out, nature team rosters players' statistical records. For example, hitting ball 330 feet (100 m) field easy catch warning track park, another. A team plays park short field, New York Yankees, stock roster left-handed pull hitters, best exploit it. On individual level, player spends career team plays hitter's park advantage batting statistics time—even talents suited park. Statistics Organized baseball lends statistics greater degree sports. Each play discrete small number outcomes. In 19th century, cricket player, English-born Henry Chadwick Brooklyn, New York, responsible "development box score, tabular standings, annual baseball guide, batting average, common statistics tables describe baseball." The statistical record central game's "historical essence" Chadwick Father Baseball. In 1920s, American newspapers began devoting attention baseball statistics, initiating journalist historian Alan Schwarz describes "tectonic shift sports, intrigue focused teams began individual players statistics lines."The Official Baseball Rules administered Major League Baseball require official scorer categorize baseball play unambiguously. The rules detailed criteria promote consistency. The score report official basis box score game relevant statistical records. General managers, managers, baseball scouts statistics evaluate players strategic decisions.Certain traditional statistics familiar baseball fans. The basic batting statistics include:At bats: plate appearances, excluding walks pitches—where batter's ability tested—and sacrifices sacrifice flies—where batter intentionally order advance baserunnersHits: reached base batted, fair ball fielding error fielder's choiceRuns: circling bases reaching safelyRuns batted (RBIs): number runners scored batter's action (including batter, case run), batter grounded double play reached errorHome runs: hits batter touched bases, contribution fielding errorBatting average: hits divided bats—the traditional measure batting abilityThe basic baserunning statistics include:Stolen bases: advancing base entirely runner's efforts, generally pitcher preparing deliver delivering ballCaught stealing: tagged attempting steal baseThe basic pitching statistics include:Wins: credited pitcher winning team pitched team lead relinquished (a starting pitcher pitch qualify win)Losses: charged pitcher losing team pitching opposing team lead relinquishedSaves: games pitcher enters game led pitcher's team, finishes game surrendering lead, winning pitcher, (a) lead three runs pitcher entered game; (b) tying base, bat, deck; (c) pitcher pitched three inningsInnings pitched: recorded pitching divided three (partial conventionally recorded as, e.g., "5.2" "7.1", digit representing thirds, tenths, inning)Strikeouts: pitching three strikes batterWinning percentage: wins divided decisions (wins losses)Earned average (ERA): runs allowed, excluding fielding errors, pitchedThe basic fielding statistics include:Putouts: fielder catches ball, tags forces runner, directly effects outAssists: putout fielder recorded fielder touching ballErrors: fielder fails play common effort, batting team benefits resultTotal chances: putouts assists errorsFielding average: chances (putouts assists) divided total chancesAmong statistics collectively situational statistics. For example, statistics indicate pitchers batter performs best against. If situation statistically favors batter, manager fielding team change pitchers pitcher intentionally walk batter order face succeed. Sabermetrics Sabermetrics refers field baseball statistical study development statistics analytical tools. The term refer directly statistics themselves. The term coined 1980 field's leading proponents, Bill James, derives Society American Baseball Research (SABR).The growing popularity sabermetrics 1980s brought attention batting statistics sabermetricians argue better gauges batter's skill batting average:On-base percentage measures batter's ability base. It calculated sum batter's successes base (hits walks pitches) dividing batter's total plate appearances (at bats walks pitches sacrifice flies), sacrifice bunts.Slugging percentage measures batter's ability power. It calculated batter's total bases (one single, double, three triple, run) dividing batter's bats.Some statistics devised sabermetricians gained use:On-base slugging (OPS) measures batter's ability. It calculated adding batter's on-base percentage slugging percentage.Walks hits pitched (WHIP) measures pitcher's ability preventing hitters reaching base. It calculated exactly suggests. Popularity cultural impact Writing 1919, philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen described baseball America's national religion. In sports columnist Jayson Stark, baseball "a unique paragon American culture"—a status sees devastated steroid abuse scandal. Baseball national cultures well: Scholar Peter Bjarkman describes "how deeply sport ingrained history culture nation Cuba, [and] thoroughly radically reshaped nativized Japan." Since 1980s, Dominican Republic, city San Pedro Macorís, major leagues' primary source foreign talent. Hall-of-Famer Roberto Clemente remains greatest national heroes Puerto Rico's history. While baseball island's primary athletic pastime, well-attended professional winter league declined popularity 1990, young Puerto Rican players began included major leagues' annual first-year player draft. In Western Hemisphere, baseball leading sports Canada, Colombia, Mexico, Netherlands Antilles, Nicaragua, Panama, Venezuela. In Asia, popular sports Japan, South Korea Taiwan.The major league game United States originally targeted middle-class, white-collar audience: spectator pastimes, National League's set ticket price 50 cents 1876 high, location playing fields inner city workweek daytime scheduling games obstacles blue-collar audience. A century later, situation different. With popularity team sports higher average ticket prices—football, basketball, hockey—professional baseball blue-collar-oriented leading American spectator sports.In 1900s 2000s, baseball's position compared football United States moved contradictory directions. In 2008, Major League Baseball set revenue record $6.5 billion, matching NFL's revenue decades. A MLB revenue record $6.6 billion set 2009. On hand, percentage American sports fans polled named baseball favorite sport 16%, compared football 31%. In 1985, figures football 24%, baseball 23%. Because major league baseball games played, comparison attendance. In 2008, total attendance major league games second-highest history: 78.6 million, 0.7% record set year. The year, amid U.S. recession, attendance fell 6.6% 73.4 million. Attendance games held Minor League Baseball umbrella set record 2007, 42.8 million; figure include attendance games independent minor leagues.In Japan, baseball inarguably leading spectator team sport, combined revenue twelve teams Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), oversees Central Pacific leagues, estimated $1 billion 2007. Total NPB attendance year 20 million. While preceding decades, MLB attendance grew 50 percent revenue tripled, comparable NPB figures stagnant. There concerns MLB's growing interest acquiring star Japanese players hurt game country. In Cuba, baseball reckoning national sport, national team overshadows city provincial teams play top-level domestic leagues. Revenue figures released country's amateur system. Similarly, official pronouncement, sport's governing authority "has account attendance ... greatest interest development athletes".As 2007, Little League Baseball oversees 7,000 children's baseball leagues 2.2 participants–2.1 United States 123,000 countries. Babe Ruth League teams 1 participants. According president International Baseball Federation, 300,000 500,000 women girls play baseball world, including Little League introductory game Tee Ball.A varsity baseball team established physical education departments high schools colleges United States. In 2008, half high schoolers 35,000 collegians played schools' baseball teams. The number Americans participating baseball declined 1980s, falling well number soccer participants. By 20th century, intercollegiate baseball Japan's leading sport. Today, high school baseball immensely popular there. The final rounds annual tournaments—the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament spring, National High School Baseball Championship summer—are broadcast country. The tournaments known, respectively, Spring Koshien Summer Koshien 55,000-capacity stadium played. In Cuba, baseball mandatory system physical education, six. Talented children young district schools intensive training—the step ladder acme national baseball team. Baseball popular culture Baseball broad impact popular culture, United States elsewhere. Dozens English-language idioms derived baseball; particular, game source number sexual euphemisms. The networked radio broadcasts North America 1922 World Series: famed sportswriter Grantland Rice announced play-by-play New York City's Polo Grounds WJZ–Newark, New Jersey, connected wire WGY–Schenectady, New York, WBZ–Springfield, Massachusetts. The baseball cap ubiquitous fashion item United States Japan, countries sport popular, United Kingdom.Baseball inspired works entertainment. One major examples, Ernest Thayer's poem "Casey Bat", appeared 1888. A wry description failure star player called "clutch situation", poem source vaudeville staged performances, audio recordings, film adaptations, opera, well host sequels parodies media. There baseball movies, including Academy Award–winning The Pride Yankees (1942) Oscar nominees The Natural (1984) Field Dreams (1989). The American Film Institute's selection best sports movies includes The Pride Yankees number 3 Bull Durham (1988) number 5. Baseball provided thematic material hits stage—the Adler–Ross musical Damn Yankees—and record—George J. Gaskin's "Slide, Kelly, Slide", Simon Garfunkel's "Mrs. Robinson", John Fogerty's "Centerfield". The baseball-inspired comedic sketch "Who's First", popularized Abbott Costello 1938, famous. Six decades later, Time named best comedy routine 20th century. Baseball featured video games including MLB: The Show, Wii Sports, Kinect Sports: Season 2 Mario Baseball.Literary works connected game include short fiction Ring Lardner novels Bernard Malamud's The Natural (the source movie), Robert Coover's The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop., W. P. Kinsella's Shoeless Joe (the source Field Dreams). Baseball's literary canon includes beat reportage Damon Runyon; columns Grantland Rice, Red Smith, Dick Young, Peter Gammons; essays Roger Angell. Among celebrated nonfiction books field Lawrence S. Ritter's The Glory Their Times, Roger Kahn's The Boys Summer, Michael Lewis's Moneyball. The 1970 publication major league pitcher Jim Bouton's tell-all chronicle Ball Four considered turning point reporting professional sports.Baseball inspired creation cultural forms. Baseball cards introduced 19th century trade cards. A typical example feature image baseball player advertising business other. In 1900s produced promotional items tobacco confectionery companies. The 1930s popularization modern style baseball card, player photograph accompanied rear statistics biographical data. Baseball cards—many prized collectibles—are source broader trading card industry, involving products sports non-sports-related fields.Modern fantasy sports began 1980 Rotisserie League Baseball New York writer Daniel Okrent friends.

Memory faculty mind encoded, stored, retrieved (Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1968). Memory vital experiences limbic systems, retention purpose influencing future action. If remember events, learn develop language, relationships, personal identity (Eysenck, 2012).Often memory understood informational processing system explicit implicit functioning sensory processor, short-term (or working) memory, long-term memory (Baddely, 2007). The sensory processor allows sensed chemical physical stimuli attended levels focus intent. Working memory serves encoding retrieval processor. Information stimuli encoded explicit implicit functions working memory processor. The working memory retrieves stored material. Finally, function long-term memory store data categorical models systems (Baddely, 2007).Explicit implicit functions memory declarative non-declarative systems (Squire, 2009). These systems involve purposeful intention memory retrieval storage, lack thereof. Declarative, explicit, memory conscious storage recollection data (Graf & Schacter, 1985). Under declarative memory resides semantic episodic memory. Semantic memory refers memory encoded meaning (Eysenck, 2012), episodic memory refers encoded spatial temporal plane (Schacter & Addis, 2007; Szpunar, 2010). Declarative memory primary process thought referencing memory (Eysenck, 2012).Non-declarative, implicit, memory unconscious storage recollection (Foerde & Poldrack, 2009). An example non-declarative process unconscious learning retrieval procedural memory, priming phenomenon (Eysenck, 2012; Foerde & Poldrack, 2009; Tulving & Schacter, 1990). Priming process subliminally arousing responses memory memory consciously activated (Tulving & Schacter, 1990), procedural memory slow gradual learning skills occurs conscious attention learning (Eysenck, 2012; Foerde & Poldrack, 2009).Memory perfect processor, factors. The manner encoded, stored, retrieved corrupted. The amount attention stimuli diminish amount encoded storage (Eysenck, 2012). Also, storage process corrupted physical damage areas brain associated memory storage, hippocampus (Squire, 2009). Finally, retrieval long-term memory disrupted decay long-term memory (Eysenck, 2012). Normal functioning, decay time, brain damage accuracy capacity memory.From processing perspective three stages retrieval memory:Encoding registration: receiving, processing combining received informationStorage: creation record encoded short-term long-term memoryRetrieval, recall recollection: calling stored response cue process activityThe loss memory described forgetfulness amnesia. Sensory memory Sensory memory holds sensory second item perceived. The ability item remember looked split second observation, memorization, example sensory memory. It cognitive control automatic response. With short presentations, participants report "see" report. The experiments exploring sensory memory precisely conducted George Sperling (1963) "partial report paradigm". Subjects presented grid 12 letters, arranged three rows four. After presentation, subjects played high, medium tone, cuing rows report. Based partial report experiments,Sperling capacity sensory memory 12 items, degraded (within milliseconds). Because memory degrades quickly, participants display unable report items (12 "whole report" procedure) decayed. This type memory prolonged rehearsal.Three types sensory memories exist. Iconic memory fast decaying store visual information; type sensory memory stores image perceived small duration. Echoic memory fast decaying store auditory information, type sensory memory stores sounds perceived short durations. Haptic memory type sensory memory represents database touch stimuli. Short-term memory Short-term memory working memory. Short-term memory allows recall period seconds minute rehearsal. Its capacity limited: George A. Miller (1956), working Bell Laboratories, conducted experiments showing store short-term memory 7±2 items (the title famous paper, "The magical number 7±2"). Modern estimates capacity short-term memory lower, typically order 4–5 items; however, memory capacity increased process called chunking. For example, recalling ten-digit telephone number, person chunk digits three groups: first, area code (such 123), three-digit chunk (456) lastly four-digit chunk (7890). This method remembering telephone numbers effective attempting remember string 10 digits; chunk meaningful groups numbers. This reflected countries tendency display telephone numbers chunks numbers.Short-term memory believed acoustic code storing information, lesser extent visual code. Conrad (1964) test subjects difficulty recalling collections letters acoustically (e.g. E, P, D). Confusion recalling acoustically letters visually letters implies letters encoded acoustically. Conrad's (1964) study, however, deals encoding written text; thus, memory written language acoustic components, generalisations forms memory made. Long-term memory The storage sensory memory short-term memory generally strictly limited capacity duration, retained indefinitely. By contrast, long-term memory store larger quantities unlimited duration (sometimes life span). Its capacity immeasurable. For example, random seven-digit number remember seconds forgetting, suggesting stored short-term memory. On hand, remember telephone numbers years repetition; stored long-term memory.While short-term memory encodes acoustically, long-term memory encodes semantically: Baddeley (1966) discovered that, 20 minutes, test subjects difficulty recalling collection meanings (e.g. big, large, great, huge) long-term. Another long-term memory episodic memory, "which attempts capture 'what', 'when' 'where'". With episodic memory, individuals recall events birthday parties weddings.Short-term memory supported transient patterns neuronal communication, dependent regions frontal lobe (especially dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) parietal lobe. Long-term memory, hand, maintained stable permanent changes neural connections spread brain. The hippocampus essential (for learning information) consolidation short-term long-term memory, store itself. It thought hippocampus memories unable stored long-term memory short attention span, gleaned patient Henry Molaison thought removal hippocampi. More examination brain, post-mortem, hippocampus intact thought, throwing theories drawn initial data question. The hippocampus involved changing neural connections period three months initial learning.Research suggested long-term memory storage humans maintained DNA methylation, prions. Models Models memory abstract representations memory believed work. Below models proposed years psychologists. Controversy involved memory structures exist. Atkinson–Shiffrin The multi-store model (also Atkinson–Shiffrin memory model) described 1968 Atkinson Shiffrin.The multi-store model criticised simplistic. For instance, long-term memory believed multiple subcomponents, episodic procedural memory. It proposes rehearsal mechanism eventually reaches long-term storage, evidence capable remembering things rehearsal.The model memory stores single unit differently. For example, short-term memory broken units visual acoustic information. In study Zlonoga Gerber (1986), patient 'KF' demonstrated deviations Atkinson–Shiffrin model. Patient KF brain damaged, displaying difficulties short-term memory. Recognition sounds spoken numbers, letters, easily identifiable noises (such doorbells cats meowing) impacted. Interestingly, visual short-term memory unaffected, suggesting dichotomy visual audial memory. Working memory In 1974 Baddeley Hitch proposed "working memory model" replaced general concept short-term memory active maintenance short-term storage. In model, working memory consists three basic stores: central executive, phonological loop visuo-spatial sketchpad. In 2000 model expanded multimodal episodic buffer (Baddeley's model working memory).The central executive essentially acts attention sensory store. It channels three component processes: phonological loop, visuo-spatial sketchpad, episodic buffer.The phonological loop stores auditory silently rehearsing sounds continuous loop: articulatory process (for example repetition telephone number again). A short list data easier remember.The visuospatial sketchpad stores visual spatial information. It engaged performing spatial tasks (such judging distances) visual (such counting windows house imagining images).The episodic buffer dedicated linking domains integrated units visual, spatial, verbal chronological ordering (e.g., memory story movie scene). The episodic buffer assumed links long-term memory semantical meaning.The working memory model explains practical observations, easier tasks (one verbal visual) tasks (e.g., visual), aforementioned word-length effect. However, concept central executive criticised inadequate vague. Working memory premise allows everyday activities involving thought. It memory carry thought processes learn reason topics. Types Researchers distinguish recognition recall memory. Recognition memory tasks require individuals indicate encountered stimulus (such picture word) before. Recall memory tasks require participants retrieve learned information. For example, individuals asked produce series actions list heard before. By type Topographic memory involves ability orient oneself space, recognize itinerary, recognize familiar places. Getting lost traveling example failure topographic memory.Flashbulb memories clear episodic memories unique highly emotional events. People remembering heard news President Kennedy's assassination, Sydney Siege 9/11 examples flashbulb memories.Anderson (1976) divides long-term memory declarative (explicit) procedural (implicit) memories. Declarative Declarative memory requires conscious recall, conscious process information. It called explicit memory, consists explicitly stored retrieved.Declarative memory sub-divided semantic memory, concerning principles facts independent context; episodic memory, concerning context, place. Semantic memory allows encoding abstract knowledge world, "Paris capital France". Episodic memory, hand, personal memories, sensations, emotions, personal associations time. Episodic memories reflect "firsts" life kiss, day school winning championship. These events one's life remembered clearly. Autobiographical memory memory events one's life generally viewed equivalent to, subset of, episodic memory. Visual memory memory preserving characteristics senses pertaining visual experience. One memory resembles objects, places, animals people sort mental image. Visual memory priming assumed kind perceptual representational system underlies phenomenon. Procedural In contrast, procedural memory (or implicit memory) based conscious recall information, implicit learning. It best summarized remembering something. Procedural memory employed learning motor skills considered subset implicit memory. It revealed better task repetition explicit memories formed, unconsciously accessing aspects experiences. Procedural memory involved motor learning depends cerebellum basal ganglia.A characteristic procedural memory things remembered automatically translated actions, difficult describe. Some examples procedural memory include ability ride bike tie shoelaces. By temporal direction Another major distinguish memory functions content remembered past, retrospective memory, future, prospective memory. Thus, retrospective memory category includes semantic, episodic autobiographical memory. In contrast, prospective memory memory future intentions, remembering remember (Winograd, 1988). Prospective memory broken event- time-based prospective remembering. Time-based prospective memories triggered time-cue, going doctor (action) 4pm (cue). Event-based prospective memories intentions triggered cues, remembering post letter (action) mailbox (cue). Cues action (as mailbox/letter example), lists, sticky-notes, knotted handkerchiefs, string finger exemplify cues people strategies enhance prospective memory. Study techniques To assess infants Infants language ability report memories verbal reports assess young children's memory. Throughout years, however, researchers adapted developed number measures assessing infants' recognition memory recall memory. Habituation operant conditioning techniques assess infants' recognition memory deferred elicited imitation techniques assess infants' recall memory.Techniques assess infants' recognition memory include following:Visual paired comparison procedure (relies habituation): infants presented pairs visual stimuli, black-and-white photos human faces, fixed amount time; then, familiarized photos, presented "familiar" photo photo. The spent photo recorded. Looking longer photo indicates remember "familiar" one. Studies procedure 5- 6-month-olds retain fourteen days.Operant conditioning technique: infants crib ribbon connected mobile overhead tied feet. Infants notice kick foot mobile moves – rate kicking increases dramatically minutes. Studies technique revealed infants' memory improves 18-months. Whereas 2- 3-month-olds retain operant response (such activating mobile kicking foot) week, 6-month-olds retain weeks, 18-month-olds retain operant response 13 weeks.Techniques assess infants' recall memory include following:Deferred imitation technique: experimenter infants unique sequence actions (such stick push button box) then, delay, asks infants imitate actions. Studies deferred imitation 14-month-olds' memories sequence actions months.Elicited imitation technique: deferred imitation technique; difference infants allowed imitate actions delay. Studies elicited imitation technique 20-month-olds recall action sequences twelve months later. To assess older children adults Researchers variety tasks assess older children adults' memory. Some examples are:Paired associate learning – learns associate another. For example, "safe" learn word, "green". This stimulus response.Free recall – task subject asked study list asked recall write remember, free response questions. Earlier items retroactive interference (RI), longer list, greater interference, likelihood recalled. On hand, items presented lastly suffer RI, suffer great deal proactive interference (PI), longer delay recall, items lost.Cued recall – hints information. This fill blank assessments classrooms.Recognition – subjects asked remember list pictures, point asked identify presented pictures list alternatives presented original list. This multiple choice assessments.Detection paradigm – individuals number objects color samples period time. They tested visual ability remember testers pointing testers sample, change present.Savings method – compares speed originally learning speed relearning it. The amount saved measures memory. Failures Transience – memories degrade passing time. This occurs storage stage memory, stored retrieved. This sensory, short-term, long-term storage. It general pattern rapidly forgotten couple days years, small losses days years.Absentmindedness – Memory failure lack attention. Attention plays role storing long-term memory; proper attention, stored, making impossible retrieved later. Physiology Brain areas involved neuroanatomy memory hippocampus, amygdala, striatum, mammillary bodies thought involved types memory. For example, hippocampus believed involved spatial learning declarative learning, amygdala thought involved emotional memory. Damage areas patients animal models subsequent memory deficits primary source information. However, implicating area, damage adjacent areas, pathway traveling area responsible observed deficit. Further, describe memory, counterpart, learning, solely dependent brain regions. Learning memory attributed changes neuronal synapses, thought mediated long-term potentiation long-term depression. But questioned computational well neurophysiological grounds cognitive scientist Charles R. Gallistel others.In general, emotionally charged event experience is, better remembered; phenomenon memory enhancement effect. Patients amygdala damage, however, memory enhancement effect.Hebb distinguished short-term long-term memory. He postulated memory stayed short-term storage consolidated long-term memory. Later false. Research direct injections cortisol epinephrine help storage experiences. This true stimulation amygdala. This proves excitement enhances memory stimulation hormones amygdala. Excessive prolonged stress (with prolonged cortisol) hurt memory storage. Patients amygdalar damage remember emotionally charged nonemotionally charged ones. The hippocampus explicit memory. The hippocampus memory consolidation. The hippocampus receives input parts cortex sends output parts brain also. The input secondary tertiary sensory areas processed lot already. Hippocampal damage memory loss problems memory storage. This memory loss includes retrograde amnesia loss memory events occurred shortly brain damage. Cognitive neuroscience Cognitive neuroscientists consider memory retention, reactivation, reconstruction experience-independent internal representation. The term internal representation implies definition memory components: expression memory behavioral conscious level, underpinning physical neural changes (Dudai 2007). The component called engram memory traces (Semon 1904). Some neuroscientists psychologists mistakenly equate concept engram memory, broadly conceiving persisting after-effects experiences memory; argue notion memory exist revealed behavior thought (Moscovitch 2007).One question crucial cognitive neuroscience mental experiences coded represented brain. Scientists gained knowledge neuronal codes studies plasticity, focused simple learning simple neuronal circuits; considerably clear neuronal changes involved complex examples memory, declarative memory requires storage facts events (Byrne 2007). Convergence-divergence zones neural networks memories stored retrieved. Considering kinds memory, depending types represented knowledge, underlying mechanisms, processes functions modes acquisition, brain areas support memory systems mutual relationships neuronal networks: "components memory representation distributed parts brain mediated multiple neocortical circuits." Encoding. Encoding working memory involves spiking individual neurons induced sensory input, persists sensory input disappears (Jensen Lisman 2005; Fransen al. 2002). Encoding episodic memory involves persistent changes molecular structures alter synaptic transmission neurons. Examples structural changes include long-term potentiation (LTP) spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The persistent spiking working memory enhance synaptic cellular changes encoding episodic memory (Jensen Lisman 2005).Working memory. Recent functional imaging studies detected working memory signals medial temporal lobe (MTL), brain area associated long-term memory, prefrontal cortex (Ranganath al. 2005), suggesting relationship working memory long-term memory. However, working memory signals prefrontal lobe area play role working memory MTL (Suzuki 2007).Consolidation reconsolidation. Short-term memory (STM) temporary subject disruption, long-term memory (LTM), consolidated, persistent stable. Consolidation STM LTM molecular level presumably involves processes: synaptic consolidation system consolidation. The involves protein synthesis process medial temporal lobe (MTL), transforms MTL-dependent memory MTL-independent memory months years (Ledoux 2007). In years, traditional consolidation dogma re-evaluated studies reconsolidation. These studies prevention retrieval subsequent retrieval memory (Sara 2000). New studies post-retrieval treatment protein synthesis inhibitors compounds lead amnestic (Nadel al. 2000b; Alberini 2005; Dudai 2006). These findings reconsolidation fit behavioral evidence retrieved memory carbon copy initial experiences, memories updated retrieval. Genetics Study genetics human memory infancy. A notable initial association APOE memory dysfunction Alzheimer's Disease. The genes associated varying memory continues. One candidates variation memory gene KIBRA, appears associated rate material forgotten delay period. In infancy Up mid-1980s assumed infants encode, retain, retrieve information. A growing indicates infants young 6-months recall 24-hour delay. Furthermore, revealed infants grow older store longer periods time; 6-month-olds recall 24-hour period, 9-month-olds weeks, 20-month-olds twelve months. In addition, studies age, infants store faster. Whereas 14-month-olds recall three-step sequence exposed once, 6-month-olds exposures order remember it.It 6-month-olds recall short-term, difficulty recalling temporal order information. It 9 months infants recall actions two-step sequence correct temporal order is, recalling step 1 step 2. In words, asked imitate two-step action sequence (such putting toy car base pushing plunger toy roll end), 9-month-olds imitate actions sequence correct order (step 1 step 2). Younger infants (6-month-olds) recall step two-step sequence. Researchers suggested differences fact dentate gyrus hippocampus frontal components neural network developed 6-months.In fact, term 'infantile amnesia' refers phenomenon accelerated forgetting infancy. Importantly, infantile amnesia unique humans, preclinical (using rodent models) insight precise neurobiology phenomenon. A review literature behavioral neuroscientist Dr Jee Hyun Kim suggests accelerated forgetting life partly rapid growth brain period. Aging One concerns older adults experience memory loss, hallmark symptoms Alzheimer's disease. However, memory loss qualitatively aging kind memory loss associated diagnosis Alzheimer's (Budson & Price, 2005). Research revealed individuals' performance memory tasks frontal regions declines age. Older adults exhibit deficits tasks involve knowing temporal order learned information; source memory tasks require remember circumstances context learned information; prospective memory tasks involve remembering perform future time. Older adults manage problems prospective memory appointment books, example. Effects physical exercise Physical exercise, continuous aerobic exercises running, cycling swimming, cognitive benefits effects brain. Influences brain include increases neurotransmitter levels, improved oxygen nutrient delivery, increased neurogenesis hippocampus. The effects exercise memory implications improving children's academic performance, maintaining mental abilities age, prevention cure neurological diseases. Disorders Much current knowledge memory studying memory disorders, amnesia. Loss memory amnesia. Amnesia extensive damage to: (a) regions medial temporal lobe, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, subiculum, amygdala, parahippocampal, entorhinal, perirhinal cortices (b) midline diencephalic region, dorsomedial nucleus thalamus mammillary bodies hypothalamus. There sorts amnesia, studying forms, observe defects individual sub-systems brain's memory systems, hypothesize function working brain. Other neurological disorders Alzheimer's disease Parkinson's disease memory cognition. Hyperthymesia, hyperthymesic syndrome, disorder individual's autobiographical memory, essentially meaning forget small details stored. Korsakoff's syndrome, Korsakoff's psychosis, amnesic-confabulatory syndrome, organic brain disease adversely memory widespread loss shrinkage neurons prefrontal cortex.While disorder, common temporary failure retrieval memory tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon. Sufferers Anomic aphasia (also called Nominal aphasia Anomia), however, experience tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon ongoing basis damage frontal parietal lobes brain. Influencing factors Interference hamper memorization retrieval. There retroactive interference, learning harder recall proactive interference, prior learning disrupts recall information. Although interference lead forgetting, mind situations facilitate learning information. Knowing Latin, instance, help individual learn language French – phenomenon positive transfer. Stress Stress memory learning. In response stressful situations, brain releases hormones neurotransmitters (ex. glucocorticoids catecholamines) memory encoding processes hippocampus. Behavioural animals chronic stress produces adrenal hormones impact hippocampal structure brains rats. An experimental study German cognitive psychologists L. Schwabe O. Wolf demonstrates learning stress decreases memory recall humans. In study, 48 healthy female male university students participated stress test control group. Those randomly assigned stress test group immersed cold water (the reputable SECPT 'Socially Evaluated Cold Pressor Test') three minutes, monitored videotaped. Both stress control groups presented 32 memorize. Twenty-four hours later, groups tested remember (free recall) well recognize larger list (recognition performance). The clear impairment memory performance stress test group, recalled 30% fewer control group. The researchers stress experienced learning distracts people diverting attention memory encoding process.However, memory performance enhanced material linked learning context, learning occurs stress. A separate study cognitive psychologists Schwabe Wolf retention testing context congruent original learning task (i.e., room), memory impairment detrimental effects stress learning attenuated. Seventy-two healthy female male university students, randomly assigned SECPT stress test control group, asked remember locations 15 pairs picture cards – computerized version card game "Concentration" "Memory". The room experiment infused scent vanilla, odour cue memory. Retention testing day, room vanilla scent present, room fragrance. The memory performance subjects experienced stress object-location task decreased tested unfamiliar room vanilla scent (an incongruent context); however, memory performance stressed subjects impairment tested original room vanilla scent (a congruent context). All participants experiment, stressed unstressed, performed faster learning retrieval contexts similar.This effects stress memory practical implications education, eyewitness testimony psychotherapy: students perform better tested regular classroom exam room, eyewitnesses recall details better scene event courtroom, persons suffering post-traumatic stress improve helped situate memories traumatic event appropriate context.Stressful life experiences memory loss person ages. Glucocorticoids released stress damage neurons located hippocampal region brain. Therefore, stressful situations encounters, susceptible memory loss on. The CA1 neurons hippocampus destroyed glucocorticoids decreasing release glucose reuptake glutamate. This high level extracellular glutamate allows calcium enter NMDA receptors return kills neurons. Stressful life experiences repression memories person moves unbearable memory unconscious mind. This directly relates traumatic events one's kidnappings, prisoners sexual abuse child.The term exposure stress is, impact have. However, short term exposure stress impairment memory interfering function hippocampus. Research subjects stressful situation short amount blood glucocorticoid levels increased drastically measured exposure completed. When subjects asked complete learning task short term exposure difficulties. Prenatal stress hinders ability learn memorize disrupting development hippocampus lead unestablished term potentiation offspring severely stressed parents. Although stress applied prenatally, offspring increased levels glucocorticoids subjected stress life. Sleep Making memories occurs three-step process, enhanced sleep. The three steps follows:Acquisition process storage retrieval memoryConsolidationRecallSleep acquisition recall awake. Therefore, sleep greatest memory consolidation. During sleep, neural connections brain strengthened. This enhances brain's abilities stabilize retain memories. There studies sleep improves retention memory, memories enhanced active consolidation. System consolidation takes slow-wave sleep (SWS). This process implicates memories reactivated sleep, process enhance memory. It implicates qualitative changes memories transferred long-term store sleep. When sleeping, hippocampus replays events day neocortex. The neocortex reviews processes memories, moves long-term memory. When sleep difficult learn neural connections strong, lower retention rate memories. Sleep deprivation harder focus, inefficient learning. Furthermore, studies sleep deprivation lead false memories memories properly transferred long-term memory. Therefore, proper amount sleep memory function highest level. One primary functions sleep thought improvement consolidation information, studies demonstrated memory depends sleep training test. Additionally, data neuroimaging studies activation patterns sleeping brain mirror recorded learning tasks day, suggesting memories solidified rehearsal. Construction general manipulation Although people memory operates recording equipment, case. The molecular mechanisms underlying induction maintenance memory dynamic comprise distinct phases covering window seconds lifetime. In fact, revealed memories constructed: "current hypotheses constructive processes allow individuals simulate imagine future episodes, happenings, scenarios. Since future exact repetition past, simulation future episodes requires complex system draw manner flexibly extracts recombines elements experiences constructive reproductive system." People construct memories encode and/or recall them. To illustrate, consider classic study conducted Elizabeth Loftus John Palmer (1974) people instructed watch film traffic accident asked saw. The researchers people asked, "How fast cars going smashed other?" higher estimates asked, "How fast cars going other?" Furthermore, asked week broken glass film, asked question smashed report broken glass asked question hit. There broken glass depicted film. Thus, wording questions distorted viewers' memories event. Importantly, wording question led people construct memories event – asked question smashed recalled serious car accident seen. The findings experiment replicated world, researchers consistently demonstrated people provided misleading tended misremember, phenomenon misinformation effect.Interestingly, revealed individuals repeatedly imagine actions performed events experienced false memories. For instance, Goff Roediger (1998) asked participants imagine performed (e.g., break toothpick) asked thing. Findings revealed participants repeatedly imagined performing performed session experiment. Similarly, Garry colleagues (1996) asked college students report experienced number events children (e.g., broke window hand) weeks asked imagine events. The researchers one-fourth students asked imagine events reported experienced events children. That is, asked imagine events confident experienced events.Research reported 2013 revealed artificially stimulate prior memories artificially implant false memories mice. Using optogenetics, team RIKEN-MIT scientists caused mice incorrectly associate benign environment prior unpleasant experience surroundings. Some scientists study implications studying false memory humans, treating PTSD schizophrenia. Improving A UCLA study published June 2006 issue American Journal Geriatric Psychiatry people improve cognitive function brain efficiency simple lifestyle changes incorporating memory exercises, healthy eating, physical fitness stress reduction daily lives. This study examined 17 subjects, (average 53) memory performance. Eight subjects asked "brain healthy" diet, relaxation, physical, mental exercise (brain teasers verbal memory training techniques). After 14 days, greater fluency (not memory) compared baseline performance. No term conducted, unclear intervention lasting effects memory.There loosely associated group mnemonic principles techniques vastly improve memory memory.The International Longevity Center released 2001 report includes 14–16 recommendations keeping mind good functionality advanced age. Some recommendations stay intellectually active learning, training reading, physically active promote blood circulation brain, socialize, reduce stress, sleep regular, avoid depression emotional instability observe good nutrition.Memorization method learning allows individual recall verbatim. Rote learning method used. Methods memorizing things subject discussion years writers, Cosmos Rossellius visual alphabets. The spacing individual remember list items rehearsal spaced extended period time. In contrast cramming: intensive memorization short period time. Also relevant Zeigarnik people remember uncompleted interrupted tasks better completed ones. The so-called Method loci spatial memory memorize non-spatial information. Levels processing Craik Lockhart (1972) proposed method depth processing experience stored memory, rehearsal.Organization: Mandler (1967) participants pack cards asked sort number piles system categorisation liked. When asked recall could, categories remembered words. This study suggested organization memory central aspects (Mandler, 2011).Distinctiveness: Eysenck Eysenck (1980) asked participants distinctive way, e.g. spell loud. Such participants recalled better simply list.Effort: Tyler al. (1979) participants solve series anagrams, easy (FAHTER) difficult (HREFAT). The participants recalled difficult anagrams better, presumably effort them.Elaboration: Palmere al. (1983) participants descriptive paragraphs fictitious African nation.

Boards larger pockets beginners easier game play. On traditional carrom boards, corner pockets larger carrom men, smaller striker. On boards larger pockets, pocket striker, "scratch shot" Pool. This "due." On "due", player return pocketed carrom board. When scores tied point carrom game, tie-breaker played. The team pocketed "queen" advantage. The Standardised Association Federation size 29" 29" Play Surface borders 2" 4" each. Other play areas Tournaments Competitions. American carrom American carrom variant carrom derived America missionaries East, 1890. Concerned young boys loitering pool halls, Sunday school teacher named Henry L. Haskell altered game Western tastes. Much game same, striker's weight reduced carrom men smaller. Generally, disks, carrom men (including striker) rings, originally wood today commercially plastic. In addition, alternative fingers flick striker, American carrom boards miniature cue sticks. American carrom boards pockets built corners, circular holes board, pocketing easier. While traditionally boards vary widely, current commercially produced American carrom boards 28 inches (71 cm) square, printed checkerboard backgammon patterns, others, sold dice, skittles, etc. allow games played board. These boards built play crokinole with.A rare series Western Carrom boards variant referred colloquially "Carrom maze" reverse, entirely game played. The oblique board fashioned labyrinth addition small plywood "walls" restrict carrom defined paths; objective traverse maze single carrom reach region designated maze amount strokes (similarly golf), finish maze competitors. Various regions maze, "traps" sharp corners differently colored designated artwork, regions player's carrom caught rest, risk penalty extra strokes forced relocation player's carrom earlier position. Positive bonus regions, small target, offer "shortcuts" relocating region nearer goal, stroke count reduction. In solo play, course records public tables. Japanese carrom Carrom introduced Japan 20th century. Carrom popular tōkyūban (闘球盤?, Japanese "pounding board", "fight ball board" "throw ball board") fell popularity Showa period. However, carrom popular Hikone, Shiga Hikone Karomu (Hikone carrom). The Hikone carrom board larger pockets (not pichenotte), discs arranged (also pichenotte), player twelve discs nine, queen (known "jack") pocketed (similar Eight-ball Black ball).

Chess two-player strategy board game played chessboard, checkered gameboard 64 squares arranged 8×8 grid. Chess played millions people worldwide.Each player game 16 pieces: king, queen, rooks, knights, bishops, pawns. Each piece types moves differently, powerful queen powerful pawn. The objective checkmate opponent's placing inescapable threat capture. To end, player's pieces attack capture opponent's pieces, supporting other. In addition checkmate, game voluntary resignation opponent, typically occurs material lost, checkmate appears unavoidable. A game draw.Chess believed originated India 7th century, derived Indian game chaturanga. Chaturanga ancestor Eastern strategy games xiangqi, janggi, shogi. The pieces assumed current powers Spain 15th century; rules finally standardized 19th century. The generally recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed title 1886. Since 1948, World Championship regulated FIDE, game's international governing body. FIDE organizes Women's World Championship, World Junior Championship, World Senior Championship, Blitz Rapid World Championships, Chess Olympiad, popular competition teams nations. There Correspondence Chess World Championship World Computer Chess Championship. Online chess opened amateur professional competition varied group players. There chess variants utilize rules, pieces, boards. One these, Chess960 (also called "Fischerandom") achieved widespread popularity chess players.FIDE awards titles skilled players, highest grandmaster. Many national chess organizations title system; however, recognized FIDE. The term "master" refer formal title describe loosely skilled player.Until recently, chess recognized sport International Olympic Committee; national sporting bodies Spanish Consejo Superior Deportes recognize chess sport. Chess included 2006 2010 Asian Games.Since second half 20th century, computers programmed play chess increasing success, point strongest computers play higher level best human players. Since 1990s, computer analysis contributed chess theory, endgame. The computer IBM Deep Blue machine overcome reigning World Chess Champion match defeated Garry Kasparov 1997. The computer programs (called "engines") hand-held devices led increasing concerns cheating tournaments. Rules The official rules chess maintained FIDE (Fédération Internationale Échecs), chess's international governing body. Along official chess tournaments, rules described FIDE Handbook, Laws Chess section. Setup Chess played square board rows (called ranks denoted numbers 1 8) columns (called files denoted letters h). The colors 64 squares alternate referred dark squares. The chessboard square right-hand rank nearest player.By convention, game pieces divided white black sets, players referred White Black respectively. Each player game 16 pieces color, consist king, queen, rooks, bishops, knights, pawns. The pieces set diagram photo, queen square color, white queen square black queen dark. Movement The player white pieces moves first. After move, players alternately move piece turn (except castling, pieces moved). Pieces moved unoccupied square occupied opponent's piece, captured removed play. With sole exception passant, pieces capture moving square opponent's piece occupies. A player move leave player's attack. A player "pass"; turn legal move (this basis finesse called zugzwang).If player move legal move, game over; checkmate (a loss player legal moves) attack, stalemate (a draw) not.Each chess piece moving. In diagrams, dots mark squares piece move intervening piece(s) color.The moves square direction. The move called castling involves moving rook.The rook move number squares rank file, leap pieces. Along king, rook involved king's castling move.The bishop move number squares diagonally, leap pieces.The queen combines power rook bishop move number squares rank, file, diagonal, leap pieces.The knight moves closest squares rank, file, diagonal, move forms "L"-shape: squares vertically square horizontally, squares horizontally square vertically. The knight piece leap pieces.The pawn move forward unoccupied square front file, move advance squares file, provided squares unoccupied (black dots diagram); pawn capture opponent's piece square diagonally front adjacent file, moving square (black "x"s). A pawn moves: passant capture promotion. Castling Once game, allowed move, castling. Castling consists moving squares rank rook (which player's rank) placing rook square crossed. Castling permissible conditions:Neither rook moved game.There pieces rook.The check, pass squares attack enemy pieces, move square check. Note castling permissible rook attacked, rook crosses square attacked. En passant When pawn advances squares starting position opponent's pawn adjacent file destination square, opponent's pawn capture passant (in passing), move square pawn passed over. This move, forfeit. For example, black pawn advanced squares g7 (initial starting position) g5, white pawn f5 passant g6 (but White's move). Promotion When pawn advances eighth rank, move promoted exchanged player's choice queen, rook, bishop, knight color. Usually, pawn chosen promoted queen, cases piece chosen; called underpromotion. In diagram right, pawn c7 advanced eighth rank promoted allowed piece. There restriction piece chosen promotion, pieces type start game (for example, queens). Check When attack opponent's pieces, check. A response check legal move position longer direct attack (that is, check). This involve capturing checking piece; interposing piece checking piece (which attacking piece queen, rook, bishop square king); moving square attack. Castling permissible response check. The object game checkmate opponent; occurs opponent's check, legal remove attack. It illegal player move leave player's check.In casual games common "check" putting opponent's check, required rules game, tournaments. End game Win Games ways:Checkmate: The player turn move check legal move escape check.Resignation: Either player resign, conceding game opponent. It considered etiquette play hopeless position, reason high-level games rarely checkmate.Win time: In games control, player wins opponent runs time, opponent superior position, player theoretical possibility checkmate opponent.Forfeit: A player cheats, violates rules game, violates rules tournament forfeited. In high-level tournaments, players forfeited things arriving game (even matter seconds), receiving text cell phone, refusing undergo drug test, refusing undergo electronic devices, unsporting behavior (such refusing shake opponent's hand). Draw There games draw:Draw agreement: Draws commonly reached mutual agreement players. The correct procedure verbally offer draw, move, start opponent's clock. Traditionally, players allowed agree draw point game, occasionally playing move; years efforts discourage short draws, example forbidding draw offers move thirty.Stalemate: The player turn move legal move check.Threefold repetition position: This commonly occurs avoid repeating moves incurring disadvantage. In situation, player claim draw; requires players valid written record game claim verified arbiter challenged. The three occurrences position occur consecutive moves claim valid. FIDE rules mention perpetual check; type draw threefold repetition.Fifty-move rule: If 50 moves pawn moved capture made, player claim draw. There fact endgames theoretically force require 50 moves pawn move capture made; examples include endgames knights pawn pawnless endgames queen bishops. These endings rare, players study detail, fifty-move rule considered adequate over-the-board play. Some correspondence chess organizations allow exceptions fifty-move rule.Fivefold repetition position: Similar threefold-repetition rule, case player claim draw game drawn. This rule 1 July 2014 establishes theoretical upper bound length lawful chess games.Seventy-five-move rule: Similar fifty-move rule; however, final move sequence checkmate, takes precedence. As fivefold-repetition rule, applies independently claims players. This rule 1 July 2014 establishes, independently, upper bound game length.Insufficient material: If player theoretical possibility checkmate opponent; example, player knight left, opponent left, checkmate impossible game drawn rule. On hand, players knight left, highly theoretical possibility checkmate, rule apply.Draw time: In games control, game drawn player opponent theoretical possibility checkmate player. Time control Chess games played control, club professional players. If player's runs game completed, game automatically lost (provided opponent pieces left deliver checkmate). The duration game ranges games played hours shorter rapid chess games, lasting 30 minutes hour game. Even shorter blitz chess, control 3 15 minutes player, bullet chess (under 3 minutes). In tournament play, controlled game clock displays, player's remaining time. Notation recording moves Chess games positions recorded system notation, commonly algebraic chess notation. Abbreviated (or short) algebraic notation generally records moves "abbreviation piece moved – file moved – rank moved". The pieces identified initials. In English, K (King), Q (Queen), R (Rook), B (Bishop), N (Knight; N avoid confusion King). For example, Qg5 "queen moves g-file 5th rank" (that is, square g5). Chess literature published languages initials indicate pieces, Figurine Algebraic Notation avoid language difficulties. To resolve ambiguities, letter number indicate file rank piece moved, e.g. Ngf3 "knight g-file moves square f3", R1e2 "rook rank moves e2". The letter P pawn used, e4 "pawn moves square e4".If piece capture, "x" inserted destination square. Thus Bxf3 "bishop captures f3". When pawn capture, file pawn departed piece initial, ranks unambiguous. For example, exd5 (pawn e-file captures piece d5) exd (pawn e-file captures piece d-file). Particularly Germany, publications ":" "x" indicate capture, rare. Some publications capture symbol altogether, exd5 rendered simply "ed".If pawn moves rank, achieving promotion, piece chosen indicated move, example e1Q e1Q. Castling indicated notations 0-0 kingside castling 0-0-0 queenside castling. An passant capture marked notation "e.p." A move places opponent's check notation "+" added. (The notation "++" double check considered obsolete.) Checkmate indicated "#". At game, "1–0" "White won", "0–1" "Black won", "½–½" indicates draw.Chess moves annotated punctuation marks symbols. For example, "!" indicates good move, "!!" excellent move, "?" mistake, "??" blunder, "!?" interesting move best, "?!" dubious move easily refuted.For example, variation simple trap Scholar's (see animated diagram) recorded: 1. e4 e5 2. Qh5?! Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6?? 4. Qxf7# 1–0The text-based Portable Game Notation (PGN), understood chess software, based short English language algebraic notation.Until 1980, majority English language chess publications descriptive notation. In descriptive notation, files named piece occupies rank start game, square names depending White's Black's point view. For example, square "e3" algebraic notation "K3" (King's 3rd) White's point view, "K6" (King's 6th) Black's point view. When recording captures, captured piece named square captured (except resolve ambiguities). The "Scholar's mate" rendered descriptive notation:1. P-K4 P-K42. Q-R5?! N-QB33. B-B4 N-B3??4. QxBP# 1–0A players prefer descriptive notation, longer recognized FIDE.Another system ICCF numeric notation, recognized International Correspondence Chess Federation decline. Squares identified numeric co-ordinates, example a1 "11" h8 "88". Moves described "from" "to" squares, captures indicated. For example, opening move 1.e4 rendered 1.5254. Castling described king's move only, example 5171 White castling king's side, 5838 Black castling queen's side. Strategy tactics Chess strategy consists setting achieving long-term positioning advantages game – example, pieces – tactics concentrate maneuver. These parts chess-playing process completely separated, strategic goals achieved tactics, tactical opportunities based strategy play. A game chess divided three phases: opening, typically 10 moves, players move pieces positions battle; middlegame; endgame, pieces gone, kings typically active struggle, pawn promotion decisive. Fundamentals tactics In chess, tactics general concentrate short-term actions – short-term calculated advance human player computer. The depth calculation depends player's ability. In quiet positions possibilities sides, deep calculation difficult practical, "tactical" positions limited number forced variations, players calculate sequences moves.Simple one-move two-move tactical actions – threats, exchanges material, double attacks – combined complicated combinations, sequences tactical maneuvers forced point view players. Theoreticians describe elementary tactical methods typical maneuvers; example, pins, forks, skewers, batteries, discovered attacks (especially discovered checks), zwischenzugs, deflections, decoys, sacrifices, underminings, overloadings, interferences.A forced variation involves sacrifice tangible called combination. Brilliant combinations – Immortal Game – considered beautiful admired chess lovers. A common type chess exercise, aimed developing players' skills, showing players position decisive combination challenging find it. Fundamentals strategy Chess strategy concerned evaluation chess positions setting goals long-term plans future play. During evaluation, players account numerous factors pieces board, control center centralization, pawn structure, safety, control squares groups squares (for example, diagonals, open files, dark squares).The basic step evaluating position count total pieces sides. The point values purpose based experience; pawns considered worth point, knights bishops three points each, rooks points (the difference rook bishop knight exchange), queens points. The valuable pieces combined, checkmate loses game. But practical terms, endgame fighting piece generally powerful bishop knight powerful rook. These basic values modified factors position piece (for example, advanced pawns valuable initial squares), coordination pieces (for example, pair bishops coordinate better bishop knight), type position (knights generally better closed positions pawns bishops powerful open positions).Another factor evaluation chess positions pawn structure (sometimes pawn skeleton), configuration pawns chessboard. Since pawns mobile chess pieces, pawn structure static determines strategic nature position. Weaknesses pawn structure, isolated, doubled, backward pawns holes, created, permanent. Care avoid weaknesses compensated valuable asset (for example, possibility developing attack). Phases Opening A chess opening group initial moves game (the "opening moves"). Recognized sequences opening moves referred openings names Ruy Lopez Sicilian Defence. They catalogued reference works Encyclopaedia Chess Openings. There dozens openings, varying character quiet positional play (for example, Réti Opening) aggressive (the Latvian Gambit). In opening lines, exact sequence considered best worked 30 moves. Professional players spend years studying openings continue careers, opening theory continues evolve.The fundamental strategic aims openings similar:Development: This technique placing pieces (particularly bishops knights) squares optimal impact game.Control center: Control central squares allows pieces moved board easily, cramping opponent.King safety: It critical safe dangerous possibilities. A correctly timed castling enhance this.Pawn structure: Players strive avoid creation pawn weaknesses isolated, doubled, backward pawns, pawn islands – force weaknesses opponent's position.Most players theoreticians consider White, virtue move, game small advantage. This initially White initiative. Black strives neutralize White's advantage achieve equality, develop dynamic counterplay unbalanced position. Middlegame The middlegame game starts opening. There clear opening middlegame, typically middlegame start pieces developed. (Similarly, clear transition middlegame endgame; start endgame.) Because opening theory ended, players plans based features position, account tactical possibilities position. The middlegame phase combinations occur. Combinations series tactical moves executed achieve gain. Middlegame combinations connected attack opponent's king. Some typical patterns names; example, Boden's Mate Lasker–Bauer combination.Specific plans strategic themes groups openings type pawn structure. An example minority attack, attack queenside pawns opponent pawns queenside. The study openings connected preparation plans typical middlegames.Another strategic question middlegame reduce material transition endgame (i.e. simplify). Minor material advantages generally transformed victory endgame, stronger choose appropriate achieve ending. Not reduction material good purpose; example, light-squared bishop opponent dark-squared one, transformation bishops pawns advantageous weaker only, endgame bishops opposite colors draw, advantage pawn, two-pawn advantage. Endgame The endgame (also game ending) stage game pieces left board. There three strategic differences earlier stages game endgame:Pawns important. Endgames revolve endeavors promote pawn advancing furthest rank.The king, required safeguarding checkmate middlegame, emerges piece endgame. It brought center board protect pawns, attack enemy pawns, hinder moves opponent's king.Zugzwang, disadvantageous forces player move, factor endgames rarely stages game. In example diagram, move zugzwang: Black move play 1...Kb7 allowing White promote pawn 2.Kd7; White move permit draw, 1.Kc6 stalemate losing pawn legal move.Endgames classified type pieces remaining board. Basic checkmates positions pieces checkmate opposing king, pieces working king. For example, pawn endgames involve kings pawns sides, task stronger promote pawns. Other complicated endings classified pieces board kings, "rook pawn versus rook" endgames. History Predecessors Chess believed originated Eastern India, c. 280–550, Gupta Empire, 6th century chaturaṅga (Sanskrit: चतुरङ्ग), literally divisions [of military] – infantry, cavalry, elephants, chariotry, represented pieces evolve modern pawn, knight, bishop, rook, respectively. Thence spread eastward westward Silk Road. The earliest evidence chess nearby Sassanid Persia 600, game chatrang. Chatrang Muslim Islamic conquest Persia (633–44), named shatranj, pieces retaining Persian names. In Spanish "shatranj" rendered ajedrez ("al-shatranj"), Portuguese xadrez, Greek ζατρίκιον (zatrikion, directly Persian chatrang), rest Europe replaced versions Persian shāh ("king"), familiar exclamation English "check" "chess".The oldest archaeological artifacts, ivory chess pieces, excavated ancient Afrasiab, today's Samarkand, Uzbekistan, central Asia, 760, older. The oldest chess manual Arabic dates 840–850, written al-Adli ar-Rumi (800–870), renowned Arab chess player, titled Kitab ash-shatranj (Book chess). This lost manuscript, referenced works. The eastern migration chess, China Southeast Asia, documentation migration west. The reference chess, called Xiang Qi, China xuán guaì lù (玄怪录, record mysterious strange) dating 800. Alternatively, contend chess arose Chinese chess predecessors, contested.The game reached Western Europe Russia three routes, earliest 9th century. By year 1000, spread Europe. Introduced Iberian Peninsula Moors 10th century, described famous 13th-century manuscript covering shatranj, backgammon, dice named Libro los juegos. 1200–1700: Origins modern game Around 1200, rules shatranj started modified southern Europe, 1475, major changes game essentially today. These modern rules basic moves Italy Spain. Pawns gained option advancing squares move, bishops queens acquired modern abilities. The queen replaced earlier vizier chess piece 10th century 15th century powerful piece; consequently modern chess referred "Queen's Chess" "Mad Queen Chess". Castling, derived 'kings leap' combination pawn rook move bring safety, introduced. These rules spread western Europe. The rules concerning stalemate finalized 19th century. Also 19th century, convention White moves established (formerly White Black move first). Finally rules castling standardized – variations castling rules persisted Italy 19th century. The standard game referred Western chess international chess, Asia games chess family xiangqi prevalent. Since 19th century, rule changes technical nature, example establishing correct procedure claiming draw repetition.Writings theory play chess began appear 15th century. The Repetición Amores Arte Ajedrez (Repetition Love Art Playing Chess) Spanish churchman Luis Ramirez Lucena published Salamanca 1497. Lucena masters Portuguese Pedro Damiano, Italians Giovanni Leonardo Di Bona, Giulio Cesare Polerio Gioachino Greco, Spanish bishop Ruy López Segura developed elements openings started analyze simple endgames. 1700–1873: The Romantic Era Chess The romantic characterized opening gambits (sacrificing pawns pieces), daring attacks, brazen sacrifices. Many elaborate beautiful unsound move sequences called 'combinations' played masters time. The game played theory. A profound belief chess merit resided players' genius inherent position board pervaded chess practice.In 18th century, center European chess life moved Southern European countries France. The French masters François-André Danican Philidor, musician profession, discovered pawns chess strategy, Louis-Charles Mahé La Bourdonnais, famous series matches Irish master Alexander McDonnell 1834. Centers chess activity period coffee houses big European cities Café Régence Paris Simpson's Divan London.As 19th century progressed, chess organization developed quickly. Many chess clubs, chess books, chess journals appeared. There correspondence matches cities; example, London Chess Club played Edinburgh Chess Club 1824. Chess problems regular 19th-century newspapers; Bernhard Horwitz, Josef Kling, Samuel Loyd composed influential problems. In 1843, von Lasa published Bilguer's Handbuch Schachspiels (Handbook Chess), comprehensive manual chess theory.The modern chess tournament organized Howard Staunton, leading English chess player, held London 1851. It German Adolf Anderssen, hailed leading chess master. His brilliant, energetic attacking style typical time. Sparkling games Anderssen's Immortal game Evergreen game Morphy's Opera game regarded highest summit chess art.Deeper insight nature chess younger players. American Paul Morphy, extraordinary chess prodigy, competitors (except Howard Staunton, refused play), including Anderssen, short chess career 1857 1863. Morphy's stemmed combination brilliant attacks sound strategy; intuitively knew prepare attacks. 1873–1945: Birth sport Prague-born Wilhelm Steinitz 1873 described avoid weaknesses one's position create exploit weaknesses opponent's position. The scientific approach positional understanding Steinitz revolutionized game. Steinitz break position components. Before Steinitz, players brought queen early, completely develop pieces, mounted attack opposing king, succeeded failed. The level defense players deep plan. In addition theoretical achievements, Steinitz founded tradition: triumph leading German master Johannes Zukertort 1886 regarded official World Chess Championship. Steinitz lost crown 1894 younger player, German mathematician Emanuel Lasker, maintained title 27 years, longest tenure World Champions.After 19th century, number master tournaments matches held annually grew. Some sources 1914 title chess Grandmaster formally conferred Tsar Nicholas II Russia Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, Tarrasch, Marshall, disputed claim. The tradition awarding titles continued World Chess Federation (FIDE), founded 1924 Paris. In 1927, Women's World Chess Championship established; hold title Czech-English master Vera Menchik. It prodigy Cuba, José Raúl Capablanca (World Champion 1921–1927), loved simple positions endgames, German-speaking dominance chess; undefeated tournament play years, 1924. His successor Russian-French Alexander Alekhine, attacking player died World champion 1946. He lost title Dutch player Max Euwe 1935 regained years later.Between wars, chess revolutionized theoretical school so-called hypermodernists Aron Nimzowitsch Richard Réti. They advocated controlling center board distant pieces pawns, invited opponents occupy center pawns, objects attack. 1945–present: Post-war After death Alekhine, World Champion sought. FIDE, controlled title (except interruption), tournament elite players. The winner 1948 tournament, Russian Mikhail Botvinnik, started Soviet dominance chess world. Until Soviet Union, non-Soviet champion, American Bobby Fischer (champion 1972–1975). Botvinnik revolutionized opening theory. Previously Black strove equality, neutralize White's first-move advantage. As Black, Botvinnik strove initiative beginning. In informal system World Championships, current champion decided challenger play title challenger forced seek sponsors match. FIDE set system qualifying tournaments matches. The world's strongest players seeded Interzonal tournaments, joined players qualified Zonal tournaments. The leading finishers Interzonals "Candidates" stage, initially tournament, series knockout matches. The winner Candidates play reigning champion title. A champion defeated match play rematch year later. This system operated three-year cycle. Botvinnik participated championship matches period fifteen years. He championship tournament 1948 retained title tied matches 1951 1954. In 1957, lost Vasily Smyslov, regained title rematch 1958. In 1960, lost title 23-year-old Latvian prodigy Mikhail Tal, accomplished tactician attacking player. Botvinnik regained title rematch 1961.Following 1961 event, FIDE abolished automatic deposed champion rematch, champion, Armenian Tigran Petrosian, player renowned defensive positional skills, held title cycles, 1963–1969. His successor, Boris Spassky Russia (champion 1969–1972), games positional sharp tactical style. The championship, so-called Match Century, non-Soviet challenger World War II, American Bobby Fischer, defeated Candidates opponents unheard-of margins clearly championship match. In 1975, however, Fischer refused defend title Soviet Anatoly Karpov FIDE meet demands, Karpov title default. Fischer modernized aspects chess, extensively preparing openings.Karpov defended title Viktor Korchnoi dominated 1970s 1980s string tournament successes. Karpov's reign finally ended 1985 hands Garry Kasparov, Soviet player Baku, Azerbaijan. Kasparov Karpov contested title matches 1984 1990; Karpov title back. In 1993, Garry Kasparov Nigel Short broke FIDE organize match title formed competing Professional Chess Association (PCA). From 2006, simultaneous World Champions World Championships: PCA Classical champion extending Steinitzian tradition current champion plays challenger series games, FIDE's players competing tournament determine champion. Kasparov lost Classical title 2000 Vladimir Kramnik Russia. The World Chess Championship 2006, Kramnik beat FIDE World Champion Veselin Topalov, reunified titles Kramnik undisputed World Chess Champion. In September 2007, lost title Viswanathan Anand India, championship tournament Mexico City. Anand defended title revenge match 2008, 2010 2012. In 2013, Magnus Carlsen beat Anand 2013 World Chess Championship. He defended title year, Anand, reigning champion.Chess remains highly popular pastime general populace. A 2012 survey "chess players largest communities world: 605 adults play chess regularly". Chess played year 12% British people, 15% Americans, 23% Germans, 43% Russians, 70% Indian people.

Murray estimated total number books, magazines, chess columns newspapers 5,000. B.H. Wood estimated number, 1949, 20,000. David Hooper Kenneth Whyld write that, "Since steady increase year year number chess publications. No printed." There public chess libraries: John G. White Chess Checkers Collection Cleveland Public Library, 32,000 chess books 6,000 bound volumes chess periodicals; Chess & Draughts collection National Library Netherlands, 30,000 books. Grandmaster Lothar Schmid owned world's largest private collection chess books memorabilia. David DeLucia's chess library 7,000 8,000 chess books, number autographs (letters, score sheets, manuscripts), 1,000 items "ephemera". Dirk Jan Geuzendam opines DeLucia's collection "is arguably finest chess collection world". Mathematics computers The game structure nature chess branches mathematics. Many combinatorical topological problems connected chess hundreds years. Combinatorics chess chess puzzles The number legal positions chess estimated 1043, provably 1047, game-tree complexity 10123. The game-tree complexity chess calculated Claude Shannon 10120, number Shannon number. Typically average position thirty forty moves, (in case checkmate stalemate) 218.Chess inspired combinatorial puzzles, knight's tour queens puzzle. Computer chess One mathematical challenges chess development algorithms play chess. The idea creating chess-playing machine dates 18th century; 1769, chess-playing automaton called The Turk famous exposed hoax. Serious trials based automata, El Ajedrecista, complex limited useful.Since advent digital computer 1950s, chess enthusiasts, computer engineers computer scientists built, increasing degrees seriousness success, chess-playing machines computer programs. The groundbreaking paper computer chess, "Programming Computer Playing Chess", published 1950 Shannon. He wrote:The chess machine ideal start with, since: (1) problem sharply defined allowed operations (the moves) ultimate goal (checkmate); (2) simple trivial difficult satisfactory solution; (3) chess generally considered require "thinking" skillful play; solution problem force admit possibility mechanized thinking restrict concept "thinking"; (4) discrete structure chess fits well digital nature modern computers.The Association Computing Machinery (ACM) held major chess tournament computers, North American Computer Chess Championship, September 1970. CHESS 3.0, chess program Northwestern University, championship. Nowadays, chess programs compete World Computer Chess Championship, held annually 1974. At considered curiosity, best chess playing programs extremely strong. In 1997, computer chess match classical controls reigning World Champion time: IBM's Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov 3½–2½ (it scored wins, loss, three draws). In 2009, mobile phone category 6 tournament performance rating 2898: chess engine Hiarcs 13 running mobile phone HTC Touch HD Copa Mercosur tournament wins draw. The best chess programs consistently beat strongest human players, extent human-computer matches longer attract interest chess players media.With huge databases games high analytical ability, computers help players learn chess prepare matches. Internet Chess Servers allow people find play opponents world. The presence computers modern communication tools raised concerns cheating games, notably "bathroom controversy" 2006 World Championship. Relation game theory In 1913, Ernst Zermelo chess basis theory game strategies, considered predecessors game theory. Zermelo's theorem solve chess, i.e. determine certainty outcome perfectly played game (either white force win, black force win, force draw). However, Claude Shannon, 1043 legal positions chess, impossibly compute perfect strategy feasible technology.The 11-category, game theoretical taxonomy chess includes: player, no-chance, combinatorial, Markov (present player move; led point, knowledge sequence moves required move, account passant castling, depend moves), sum, symmetric, perfect information, non-cooperative, discrete, extensive (tree decisions, payoff matrices), sequential. Computational complexity Generalized chess (played × board, fifty-move rule) EXPTIME-complete. Combinatorial game theory Some applications combinatorial game theory chess endgames Elkies (1996). Psychology There extensive scientific literature chess psychology. Alfred Binet knowledge verbal, visuospatial, ability lies core expertise. In doctoral thesis, Adriaan Groot chess masters rapidly perceive features position. According Groot, perception, years practice study, sheer ability anticipate moves. De Groot chess masters memorize positions seconds perfectly. The ability memorize account chess-playing skill, masters novices, faced random arrangements chess pieces, equivalent recall (about half dozen positions case). Rather, ability recognize patterns, memorized, distinguished skilled players novices. When positions pieces game, masters total positional recall.More focused chess mental training; roles knowledge look-ahead search; brain imaging studies chess masters novices; blindfold chess; role personality intelligence chess skill; gender differences; computational models chess expertise. The role practice talent development chess domains expertise led lot recently. Ericsson colleagues argued deliberate practice reaching high levels expertise chess. Recent indicates factors practice important. For example, Fernand Gobet colleagues stronger players started playing chess young experts born Northern Hemisphere born winter spring. Compared general population, chess players non-right-handed, correlation handedness skill. Chess intelligence Although link performance chess general intelligence assumed, researchers failed confirm existence. For example, 2006 study differences fluid intelligence, measured Raven's Progressive Matrices, adult chess players regular people. There evidence correlation performance chess intelligence players. However, performance chess relies one's experience playing game, role experience overwhelm role intelligence. Chess experts estimated excess 10,000 300,000 position patterns stored memory; training acquire amount data.A 2007 study young chess players United Kingdom players tended above-average IQ scores, but, group, correlation chess skill IQ moderately negative, meaning smarter children tended achieve lower level chess skill. This explained negative correlation intelligence practice elite subsample, practice higher influence chess skill. Variants There published chess variants, origin, including:Direct predecessors chess chaturanga shatranj.Traditional national regional games share common ancestors Western chess xiangqi, shogi, janggi, makruk, sittuyin.Modern variations employing rules (e.g. Losing chess), forces (e.g. Dunsany's chess), non-standard pieces (e.g. Grand Chess), board geometries (e.g. hexagonal chess).

Income consumption savings opportunity gained entity timeframe, generally expressed monetary terms. However, households individuals, "income sum wages, salaries, profits, interests payments, rents, forms earnings received... period time."In field public economics, term refer accumulation monetary non-monetary consumption ability, (monetary) proxy total income. Increase income Income capita increasing steadily country. Many factors contribute people higher income education, globalisation favorable political circumstances economic freedom peace. Increase income lead people choosing work hours. Developed countries (defined countries "developed economy") higher incomes opposed developing countries tending lower incomes. Economic definitions In economics, "factor income" return accruing person, nation, derived "factors production": rental income, wages generated labor, interest created capital, profits entrepreneurial ventures.From labor services, well ownership land capital.In consumer theory 'income' "budget constraint," amount Y {\displaystyle Y} spent goods quantities {\displaystyle x} {\displaystyle y} prices P {\displaystyle P_{x}} P {\displaystyle P_{y}} . The basic equation Y P ⋅ + P ⋅ {\displaystyle YP_{x}\cdot x+P_{y}\cdot y} This equation implies things. First buying unit good implies buying P P {\displaystyle {\frac {P_{x}}{P_{y}}}} units good y. So, P P {\displaystyle {\frac {P_{x}}{P_{y}}}} price unit number units y. Second, price falls fixed Y {\displaystyle Y} , price falls. The hypothesis quantity demanded increase lower price, law demand. The generalization goods consists modelling composite good.The theoretical generalization period multi-period wealth income constraint. For example, person productive skills acquire productive income-earning assets earn higher income. In multi-period case, economy control individual reduce (or increase) flow income. Changing measured income relation consumption modeled accordingly, permanent income hypothesis. Full Haig-Simons income "Full income" refers accumulation monetary non-monetary consumption-ability entity, person household. According economist Nicholas Barr describes "classical definition income" (the 1938 Haig-Simons definition): "income defined the... sum (1) market rights exercised consumption (2) change store property rights..." Since consumption non-monetary goods, leisure, measured, monetary income thought proxy income. As such, however, criticized unreliable, i.e. failing accurately reflect affluence (and consumption opportunities) agent. It omits utility person derive non-monetary income and, macroeconomic level, fails accurately chart social welfare. According Barr, "in practice money income proportion total income varies unsystematically. Non-observability full-income prevent complete characterization individual opportunity set, forcing unreliable yardstick money income. Income inequality Income inequality refers extent income distributed uneven manner. It measured methods, including Lorenz curve Gini coefficient. Economists generally agree amounts inequality desirable excessive inequality leads efficiency problems social injustice.National income, measured statistics Net National Income (NNI), measures total income individuals, corporations, government economy. For measures national income output. Income philosophy ethics Throughout history, written impact income morality society. Saint Paul wrote 'For love money root kinds evil:' (1 Timothy 6:10 (ASV)).Some scholars conclusion material progress prosperity, manifested continuous income growth individual national level, indispensable foundation sustaining kind morality. This argument explicitly Adam Smith Theory Moral Sentiments, developed Harvard economist Benjamin Friedman book The Moral Consequences Economic Growth. Accountancy The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) definition: "Income increases economic benefits accounting period inflows enhancements assets decreases liabilities increases equity, relating contributions equity participants." [F.70] (IFRS Framework).According John Hicks' definitions, income "is maximum amount spent period expectation maintaining intact, capital prospective receipts (in money terms)”.

Graphic design process visual communication problem-solving typography, photography illustration. The field considered subset visual communication communication design, term "graphic design" synonymously. Graphic designers create combine symbols, images text visual representations ideas messages. They typography, visual arts layout techniques create visual compositions. Common graphic design include corporate design (logos branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers books), wayfinding environmental design, advertising, web design, communication design, product packaging signage. History The term graphic design coined William Addison Dwiggins 1922. However, graphic design-like activities span human existence: caves Lascaux, Rome's Trajan's Column illuminated manuscripts Middle Ages, neon lights Ginza, Tokyo. In "Babylon, artisans pressed cuneiform inscriptions clay bricks tablets construction. The bricks reigning monarch, builder, dignitary". This road announcing governor mayor city. The Egyptians developed communication hieroglyphics picture symbols dating 136 B.C. Rosetta Stone. "The Rosetta stone, Napoleon's engineers advertisement Egyptian ruler, Ptolemy "true Son Sun, Father Moon, Keeper Happiness Men"" The Egyptians invented papyrus, paper reeds Nile, transcribed advertisements common people time. During "Dark Ages", 500 AD 1450 AD, monks created elaborate, illustrated manuscripts.In lengthy history explosion visual communication 20th 21st centuries, distinction advertising, art, graphic design fine disappeared. They share elements, theories, principles, practices, languages benefactor client. In advertising, ultimate objective sale goods services. In graphic design, "the essence order information, ideas, expression, feeling artifacts document human experience."Graphic design United States began Benjamin Franklin newspaper The Pennsylvania Gazette, master publicity promote books influence masses. "Benjamin Franklin's ingenuity gained strength cunning 1737 replaced counterpart Pennsylvania, Andrew Bradford postmaster printer competition instituted won. He prowess running General Magazine Historical Chronicle British Plantations America (the precursor Saturday Evening Post) stressed benefits offered stove invented, named called Pennsylvania Fireplace. His sold today Franklin stove. "American advertising initially imitated British newspapers magazines. Advertisements printed scrambled type uneven lines difficult read. Franklin better organized adding 14-point type advertisement; shortened centered it, making "headlines". Franklin illustrations, London printers attempted. Franklin utilize logos, symbols announced services opticians displaying golden spectacles. Franklin taught advertisers detail marketing products. Some advertisements 10-20 lines, including color, names, varieties, sizes goods offered. The advent printing During Tang Dynasty (618–907) wood blocks cut print textiles reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed 868 earliest printed book. Beginning 11th century, longer scrolls books produced movable type printing, making books Song dynasty (960–1279).During 17th-18th century movable type handbills trade cards printed wood copper engravings. These documents announced business location. English painter William Hogarth skill engraving design business trade.In Mainz Germany, 1448, Johann Gutenberg introduced movable type metal alloy printing press opened commerce. Previously, advertising mouth. In France England, example, criers announced products sale ancient Romans done.The printing press books available. Aldus Manutius developed book structure foundation western publication design. This graphic design called Humanist Old Style. Additionally, William Caxton, England's printer produced religious books, trouble selling them. He discovered leftover books post church doors. This practice termed "squis" "pin up" posters, 1612, print advertising Europe. The term Siquis Roman public notices posted stating "if anybody...", Latin "si quis". These printed announcements public registers called ads areas periodical Paris advertising termed "advices". The "Advices" today advice columns.In 1638 Harvard University received printing press England. More 52 years passed London bookseller Benjamin Harris received printing press Boston. Harris published newspaper serial form, 'Publick Occurrences Both Foreign Domestick'. It suppressed government edition.John Campbell credited newspaper, 'Boston News-Letter', appeared 1704. The paper revolution "Weeklies". The 13 hours required dry paper. 'The solution first, print ads print news day publication. The paper ads 20%-30% total paper, (pages four) hot news located inside.' The initial Boston News-Letter carried Campbell's solicitations advertising readers. Campbell's paid advertisement third edition, May 7 8th, 1704. Two ads stolen anvils. The third estate Oyster Bay, owned William Bradford, pioneer printer New York, sell value. Bradford published newspaper 1725, New York's first, The New York Gazette. Bradford's son preceded Philadelphia publishing American Weekly Mercury, 1719. The Mercury William Brooker's Massachusetts Gazette, published day earlier. Design industry In 19th-century Europe, United Kingdom, official publication printed design released, marking separation graphic design fine art.In 1849, Henry Cole major forces design education Great Britain, informing government design Journal Design Manufactures. He organized Great Exhibition celebration modern industrial technology Victorian design.From 1891 1896, William Morris' Kelmscott Press published graphic design products Arts Crafts movement, lucrative business creating selling stylish books. Morris created market works graphic design profession type art. The Kelmscott Press characterized obsession historical styles. This historicism reaction nineteenth-century graphic design. Morris' work, rest Private Press movement, directly influenced Art Nouveau. Twentieth century design The term "graphic design" appeared print 1922 essay "New Kind Printing Calls New Design" William Addison Dwiggins, American book designer 20th century. Raffe's Graphic Design, published 1927, book "Graphic Design" title.The signage London Underground classic design example modern typeface designed Edward Johnston 1916.In 1920s, Soviet constructivism applied 'intellectual production' spheres production. The movement individualistic useless revolutionary Russia moved creating objects utilitarian purposes. They designed buildings, theater sets, posters, fabrics, clothing, furniture, logos, menus, etc.Jan Tschichold codified principles modern typography 1928 book, New Typography. He repudiated philosophy espoused book fascistic, remained influential. Tschichold, Bauhaus typographers Herbert Bayer László Moholy-Nagy El Lissitzky greatly influenced graphic design. They pioneered production techniques stylistic devices twentieth century. The years graphic design modern style widespread acceptance application. The post-World War II American economy revealed greater graphic design, advertising packaging. The spread German Bauhaus school design Chicago 1937 brought "mass-produced" minimalism America; sparking "modern" architecture design. Notable names mid-century modern design include Adrian Frutiger, designer typefaces Univers Frutiger; Paul Rand, principles Bauhaus applied popular advertising logo design, helping create uniquely American approach European minimalism principal pioneers subset graphic design corporate identity; Josef Müller-Brockmann, designed posters severe accessible manner typical 1950s 1970s era.The professional graphic design industry grew parallel consumerism. This raised concerns criticisms, notably graphic design community First Things First manifesto. First launched Ken Garland 1964, re-published First Things First 2000 manifesto 1999 magazine Emigre 51 stating "We propose reversal priorities favor useful, lasting democratic forms communication mindshift product marketing exploration production kind meaning. The scope debate shrinking; expand. Consumerism running uncontested; challenged perspectives expressed, part, visual languages resources design." Both editions attracted signatures practitioners thinkers Rudy VanderLans, Erik Spiekermann, Ellen Lupton Rick Poynor. The 2000 manifesto published Adbusters, critiques visual culture. Applications Graphic design applied visual, road signs technical schematics, interoffice memorandums reference manuals.Design selling product idea. It applied products elements company identity logos, colors, packaging text branding (see advertising). Branding increasingly range services offered graphic designers. Graphic designers branding team.Textbooks designed subjects geography, science math. These publications layouts illustrate theories diagrams. Graphic design applied layout, formatting, illustrations charts.Graphic design applied entertainment industry decoration, scenery visual story telling. Other examples design entertainment purposes include novels, comic books, DVD covers, opening credits closing credits filmmaking, programs props stage. This include artwork T-shirts items screenprinted sale.From scientific journals news reporting, presentation opinion facts improved graphics thoughtful compositions visual design. Newspapers, magazines, blogs, television film documentaries graphic design. With advent web, designers experience interactive tools increasingly illustrate background news stories. Skills A graphic design project involve stylization presentation existing text preexisting imagery images developed graphic designer. Elements incorporated traditional digital form, involves visual arts, typography, layout techniques. Graphic designers organize optionally graphic elements. Graphic designers commission photographers illustrators create original pieces. Designers digital tools, referred interactive design, multimedia design. Designers communication skills convince audience sell designs.The "process school" concerned communication; highlights channels messages transmitted senders receivers encode decode message. The semiotic school treats message construction signs interaction receivers, produces meaning; communication agent. Typography Typography includes type design, modifying type glyphs arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) created modified illustration techniques. Type arrangement selection typefaces, point size, tracking (the space characters used), kerning (the space characters) leading (line spacing).Typography performed typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, directors clerical workers. Until digital age, typography specialized occupation. Page layout Page layout deals arrangement elements (content) page, image placement, text layout style. Page design consideration printed material extended displays web pages. Elements typically consist type (text), images (pictures), (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics elements printed die/laser cutting, foil stamping blind embossing. Printmaking Printmaking process making artworks printing paper materials surfaces. The process capable producing multiples work, called print. Each print original, technically impression. Prints created single original surface, technically matrix. Common types matrices include: plates metal, copper zinc engraving etching; stone, lithography; blocks wood woodcuts, linoleum linocuts fabric plates screen-printing. Works printed single plate create edition, modern signed numbered limited edition. Prints published book form, artist's books. A single print product multiple techniques.Aside technology, graphic design requires judgment creativity. Critical, observational, quantitative analytic thinking required design layouts rendering. If executor solution (e.g. sketch, script instructions) provided designer (such director), executor considered designer. Tools The method presentation (e.g. arrangement, style, medium) design. The development presentation tools change audience perceives project. The image layout produced traditional guides, digital image editing tools computers. Tools computer graphics traditional names "scissors" "pen". Some graphic design tools grid traditional digital form.In mid-1980s desktop publishing graphic software applications introduced computer image manipulation creation capabilities manually executed. Computers enabled designers instantly effects layout typographic changes, simulate effects traditional media. Traditional tools pencils computers finalization; designer director sketch numerous concepts creative process. Styluses tablet computers capture drawings digitally. Computers Some designers dispute computers enhance creative process. Computers allow designers explore multiple ideas detail achieved hand-rendering paste-up. However, designers find limitless choices digital design lead paralysis endless iterations clear outcome.Hand-rendered layouts approval idea execution designer invests produce finished visuals. Then idea finished computer hybrid process.Nearly popular "industry standard" software programs graphic design 1990s products Adobe Systems Incorporated. Adobe Photoshop (a raster-based program photo editing) Adobe Illustrator (a vector-based program drawing) final stage. Designers pre-designed raster images vector graphics work online design databases. Raster images edited Adobe Photoshop, logos illustrations Adobe Illustrator, final product assembled major layout programs, including Adobe InDesign. Graphic designers expected proficient programs. Related Design Fields Interface design Since advent personal computers, graphic designers involved interface design, environment commonly referred Graphical User Interface (GUI). This included web design software design, user interactivity design consideration layout interface. Combining visual communication skills understanding user interaction online branding, graphic designers work software developers web developers create feel web site software application. An aspect interface design icon design. User experience design User experience design considers user interacts responds interface, service product. Experiential graphic design Experiential graphic design application communication skills built environment. This area graphic design requires practitioners understand physical installations manufactured withstand environmental conditions buildings. As such, cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers, fabricators, city planners, architects, manufacturers construction teams.Experiential graphic designers solve problems people encounter interacting buildings space. Examples practice areas environmental graphic designers wayfinding, placemaking, branded environments, exhibitions museum displays, public installations digital environments. Occupations Graphic design career paths cover parts creative spectrum overlap. Workers perform specialized tasks, design services, publishing, advertising public relations. As 2016 median pay $53,316 year. The job titles industry country specific. They include graphic designer, director, creative director, animator entry level production artist. Depending industry served, responsibilities titles "DTP Associate" "Graphic Artist". The responsibilities involve specialized skills illustration, photography, animation interactive design.Employment design online projects expected increase 35%, traditional designs, publications, faced slower rates 16% less.Graphic designers work companies devoted industry, design consultancies branding agencies, work publishing, marketing communications companies. Especially introduction personal computers, graphic designers work in-house designers non-design oriented organizations. Graphic designers work freelance, working terms, prices, ideas, etc.A graphic designer typically reports director, creative director senior creative. As designer senior, spend designing leading directing designers broader creative activities, brand development corporate identity development. They expected interact directly clients, example interpreting briefs. Crowdsourcing graphic design Jeff Howe Wired Magazine term "crowdsourcing" 2006 article, "The Rise Crowdsourcing." It spans creative domains graphic design, architecture, apparel design, writing, illustration etc. Tasks assigned individuals group categorized convergent divergent. An example divergent task generating alternative designs poster. An example convergent task selecting poster design.

Motorcycle design varies greatly suit range purposes: distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport including racing, off-road riding. Motorcycling riding motorcycle social activity joining motorcycle club attending motorcycle rallies.In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller series production motorcycle, called motorcycle. In 2014, three motorcycle producers globally volume Honda, Yamaha (both Japan), Hero MotoCorp (India).In developing countries, motorcycles overwhelmingly utilitarian lower prices greater fuel economy. Of motorcycles world, 58% Asia-Pacific Southern Eastern Asia regions, excluding car-centric Japan.According United States Department Transportation number fatalities vehicle mile traveled 37 higher motorcycles cars. Types The term motorcycle legal definitions depending jurisdiction (see #Legal definitions restrictions).There three major types motorcycle: street, off-road, dual purpose. Within types, sub-types motorcycles purposes. There racing counterpart type, road racing street bikes, motocross dirt bikes.Street bikes include cruisers, sportbikes, scooters mopeds, types. Off-road motorcycles include types designed dirt-oriented racing classes motocross street legal areas. Dual purpose machines dual-sport style off-road include features legal comfortable street well.Each configuration offers specialised advantage broad capability, design creates riding posture. History Experimentation The internal combustion, petroleum fueled motorcycle Daimler Reitwagen. It designed built German inventors Gottlieb Daimler Wilhelm Maybach Bad Cannstatt, Germany 1885. This vehicle safety bicycles boneshaker bicycles degrees steering axis angle fork offset, principles bicycle motorcycle dynamics developed 70 years earlier. Instead, relied outrigger wheels remain upright turning.The inventors called Reitwagen ("riding car"). It designed expedient testbed engine, true prototype vehicle.The commercial design self-propelled cycle three-wheel design called Butler Petrol Cycle, conceived Edward Butler England 1884. He exhibited plans vehicle Stanley Cycle Show London 1884. The vehicle built Merryweather Fire Engine company Greenwich, 1888.The Butler Petrol Cycle three-wheeled vehicle, rear wheel directly driven 5/8hp (466W) 600 (40 in3; 2¼×5-inch {57×127-mm}) flat twin stroke engine (with magneto ignition replaced coil battery) equipped rotary valves float-fed carburettor (five years Maybach) Ackermann steering, time. Starting compressed air. The engine liquid-cooled, radiator rear driving wheel. Speed controlled throttle valve lever. No braking system fitted; vehicle stopped raising lowering rear driving wheel foot-operated lever; weight machine borne small castor wheels. The driver seated front wheels. It wasn't, however, success, Butler failed find financial backing.Many authorities excluded steam powered, electric motorcycles diesel-powered two-wheelers definition 'motorcycle', credit Daimler Reitwagen world's motorcycle. Given rapid electric motorcycles worldwide, defining internal-combustion powered two-wheelers 'motorcycles' increasingly problematic.If two-wheeled vehicle steam propulsion considered motorcycle, motorcycles built French Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede patent application filled December 1868, constructed American Roper steam velocipede, built Sylvester H. Roper Roxbury, Massachusetts. demonstrated machine fairs circuses eastern U.S. 1867, Roper built 10 steam cars cycles 1860s death 1896. Summary inventions First motorcycle companies In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller series production motorcycle, called motorcycle (German: Motorrad). Excelsior Motor Company, originally bicycle manufacturing company based Coventry, England, began production motorcycle model 1896. The production motorcycle US Orient-Aster, built Charles Metz 1898 factory Waltham, Massachusetts.In period motorcycle history, producers bicycles adapted designs accommodate internal combustion engine. As engines powerful designs outgrew bicycle origins, number motorcycle producers increased. Many nineteenth century inventors worked motorcycles moved inventions. Daimler Roper, example, develop automobiles.At turn century major mass-production firms set up. In 1898, Triumph Motorcycles England began producing motorbikes, 1903 producing 500 bikes. Other British firms Royal Enfield, Norton Birmingham Small Arms Company began motorbike production 1899, 1902 1910, respectively. Indian began production 1901 Harley-Davidson established years later. By outbreak First World War, largest motorcycle manufacturer Indian, producing 20,000 bikes year. First World War During First World War, motorbike production greatly ramped effort supply effective communications front troops. Messengers horses replaced despatch riders motorcycles carrying messages, performing reconnaissance acting military police. American company Harley-Davidson devoting 50% factory output military contract war. The British company Triumph Motorcycles sold 30,000 Triumph Type H model allied forces war. With rear wheel driven belt, Model H fitted 499 (30.5 in) air-cooled four-stroke single-cylinder engine. It Triumph pedals.The Model H particular, regarded "modern motorcycle". Introduced 1915 550 side-valve four-stroke engine three-speed gearbox belt transmission. It popular users nicknamed "Trusty Triumph." Postwar By 1920, Harley-Davidson largest manufacturer, motorcycles sold dealers 67 countries. By 1920s 1930s, DKW Germany largest manufacturer.In 1950s, streamlining began play increasing development racing motorcycles "dustbin fairing" held possibility radical changes motorcycle design. NSU Moto Guzzi vanguard development, producing radical designs well ahead time. NSU produced advanced design, deaths NSU riders 1954–1956 seasons, abandoned development Grand Prix motorcycle racing.Moto Guzzi produced competitive race machines, 1957 Grand Prix races streamlined machines. The year, 1958, enclosure fairings banned racing FIM safety concerns.From 1960s 1990s, small two-stroke motorcycles popular worldwide, partly East German Walter Kaaden's engine work 1950s. Today In 21st century, motorcycle industry dominated Chinese motorcycle industry Japanese motorcycle companies. In addition capacity motorcycles, market smaller capacity (less 300 cc) motorcycles, concentrated Asian African countries produced China India. A Japanese example 1958 Honda Super Cub, biggest selling vehicle time, 60 millionth unit produced April 2008. Today, area dominated Indian companies Hero MotoCorp emerging world's largest manufacturer wheelers. Its Splendor model sold 8.5 date. Other major producers Bajaj TVS Motors. Technical aspects Construction Motorcycle construction engineering, manufacturing, assembly components systems motorcycle performance, cost, aesthetics desired designer. With exceptions, construction modern mass-produced motorcycles standardised steel aluminium frame, telescopic forks holding front wheel, disc brakes. Some parts, designed aesthetic performance reasons added. A petrol powered engine typically consisting cylinders (and commonly, cylinders) coupled manual five- six-speed sequential transmission drives swingarm-mounted rear wheel chain, driveshaft belt. Fuel economy Motorcycle fuel economy varies greatly engine displacement riding style. A streamlined, faired Matzu Matsuzawa Honda XL125 achieved 470 mpg‑US (0.50 L/100 km; 560 mpg‑imp) Craig Vetter Fuel Economy Challenge "on highways – conditions." Due engine displacements (100 cc–200 cc), high power-to-mass ratios, motorcycles offer good fuel economy. Under conditions fuel scarcity 1950s Britain modern developing nations, motorcycles claim shares vehicle market. Electric motorcycles Very high fuel economy equivalents derived electric motorcycles. Electric motorcycles silent, zero-emission electric motor-driven vehicles. Operating range speed limited battery technology. Fuel cells petroleum-electric hybrids development extend range improve performance electric drive system. Reliability A 2013 survey 4,424 readers US Consumer Reports magazine collected reliability data 4,680 motorcycles purchased 2009 2012. The common problem areas accessories, brakes, electrical (including starters, charging, ignition), fuel systems, types motorcycles greatest problems touring, road/dual sport, sport-touring, cruisers. There sport bikes survey statistically conclusion, data hinted reliability good cruisers. These partially explained accessories including equipment fairings, luggage, auxiliary lighting, frequently touring, adventure touring/dual sport sport touring bikes. Trouble fuel systems improper winter storage, brake problems maintenance. Of brands data draw conclusions, Honda, Kawasaki Yamaha statistically tied, 11 14% bikes survey experiencing major repairs. Harley-Davidsons rate 24%, BMWs worst, 30% needing major repairs. There Triumph Suzuki motorcycles surveyed statistically sound conclusion, appeared Suzukis reliable three Japanese brands Triumphs comparable Harley-Davidson BMW. Three fourths repairs survey cost US$200 thirds motorcycles repaired days. In spite worse reliability survey, Harley-Davidson BMW owners greatest owner satisfaction, three fourths buy bike again, 72% Honda owners 60 63% Kawasaki Yamaha owners. Dynamics Different types motorcycles dynamics play role motorcycle performs conditions. For example, longer wheelbase feeling stability responding disturbances. Motorcycle tyres influence handling.Motorcycles leaned order turns. This lean induced method countersteering, rider momentarily steers handlebars direction opposite desired turn. This practice counterintuitive confusing novices – experienced motorcyclists.With short wheelbase, motorcycles generate torque rear wheel, stopping force front wheel, lift opposite wheel road. These actions, performed purpose, wheelies stoppies (or endos) respectively. Accessories Various features accessories attached motorcycle OEM (factory-fitted) aftermarket. Such accessories selected owner enhance motorcycle's appearance, safety, performance, comfort, include mobile electronics sidecars trailers. Safety Motorcycles higher rate fatal accidents automobiles trucks buses. United States Department Transportation data 2005 Fatality Analysis Reporting System passenger cars, 18.62 fatal crashes occur 100,000 registered vehicles. For motorcycles figure higher 75.19 100,000 registered vehicles – higher cars. The data 1.56 fatalities occur 100 vehicle miles travelled passenger cars, motorcycles figure 43.47 28 higher cars (37 deaths mile travelled 2007). Furthermore, motorcycles accident rates increased 1990s, rates dropped passenger cars.The common configuration motorcycle accidents United States motorist pulls turns front motorcyclist, violating right-of-way. This called SMIDSY, acronym formed motorists' common response "Sorry mate, I you". Motorcyclists anticipate avoid crashes proper training, increasing visibility traffic, keeping speed limits, consuming alcohol drugs riding.The United Kingdom organisations dedicated improving motorcycle safety providing advanced rider training pass basic motorcycle licence test. These include Institute Advanced Motorists (IAM) Royal Society Prevention Accidents (RoSPA). Along increased personal safety, riders advanced qualifications benefit reduced insurance costs In South Africa, Think Bike campaign dedicated increasing motorcycle safety awareness motorcycles country's roads. The campaign, strongest Gauteng province, representation Western Cape, KwaZulu Natal Free State. It dozens trained marshals events cycle races deeply involved numerous projects annual Motorcycle Toy Run.Motorcycle safety education offered United States organisations ranging agencies non-profit organisations corporations. Most courses designed Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF), Oregon Idaho developed own. All training programs include Basic Rider Course, Intermediate Rider Course Advanced Rider Course.In Ireland, 2010, UK Australian jurisdictions, Victoria, New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania Northern Territory, compulsory complete basic rider training course issued Learners Licence, ride public roads.In Canada, motorcycle rider training compulsory Quebec Manitoba only, provinces territories graduated licence programs restrictions drivers gained experience. Eligibility motorcycle licence endorsement completing Motorcycle Safety course varies province. The Canada Safety Council, non-profit safety organisation, offers Gearing Up program Canada endorsed Motorcycle Moped Industry Council. Training course graduates qualify reduced insurance premiums. Motorcycle rider postures The motorcyclist's riding position depends rider body-geometry (anthropometry) combined geometry motorcycle itself. These factors create set three basic postures.Sport – rider leans forward wind weight upper torso supported rider's core speed air pressure high speed (e.g., 50 mph (80 km/h)). The footpegs rider rear. The reduced frontal area cuts wind resistance allows higher speeds. At low-speed position throws weight rider arms, tire rider's wrists.Standard – rider sits upright leans forward slightly. The feet rider. These motorcycles specialised task, excel area. The standard posture touring commuting well dirt dual-sport bikes, offer advantages beginners.Cruiser – rider sits lower seat height upper torso upright leaning rearward. Legs extended forwards, reach regular controls cruiser pegs. The seat height consideration short riders. Handlebars high wide. The emphasis comfort, compromising cornering ability ground clearance greater likelihood scraping foot pegs, floor boards, parts turns speeds motorcycles accomplish.Factors motorcycle's ergonomic geometry determine seating posture include height, angle location footpegs, seat handlebars. Factors rider's physical geometry contribute seating posture include torso, arm, thigh leg length, rider height. Legal definitions restrictions A motorcycle broadly defined law countries purposes registration, taxation rider licensing powered two-wheel motor vehicle. Most countries distinguish mopeds 49 powerful, larger vehicles (scooters count separate category). Many jurisdictions include forms three-wheeled cars motorcycles. Environmental impact Motorcycles scooters' fuel consumption attracted interest United States environmentalists increased fuel prices affect. Piaggio Group Americas supported interest launch "Vespanomics" website platform, claiming lower per-mile carbon emissions 0.4 lb/mile (113 g/km) average car, 65% reduction, better fuel economy.However, motorcycle's exhaust emissions 10–20 oxides nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons exhaust similar-year passenger car SUV.

Badminton racquet sport played racquets shuttlecock net. Although played larger teams, common forms game "singles" (with player side) "doubles" (with players side). Badminton played casual outdoor activity yard beach; formal games played rectangular indoor court. Points scored striking shuttlecock racquet landing opposing side's half court.Each strike shuttlecock passes net. Play shuttlecock struck floor fault called umpire, service judge, (in absence) opposing side.The shuttlecock feathered (in informal matches) plastic projectile flies differently balls sports. In particular, feathers create higher drag, causing shuttlecock decelerate rapidly. Shuttlecocks high speed compared balls racquet sports.The game developed British India earlier game battledore shuttlecock. European play dominated Denmark game popular Asia, competition dominated China. Since 1992, badminton Summer Olympic sport events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, mixed doubles. At high levels play, sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, precision. It technical sport, requiring good motor coordination development sophisticated racquet movements. History Games employing shuttlecocks played centuries Eurasia modern game badminton developed mid-19th century British variant earlier game battledore shuttlecock. ("Battledore" older term "racquet".) Its exact origin remains obscure. The derives Duke Beaufort's Badminton House Gloucestershire, remains unclear. As 1860, London toy dealer named Isaac Spratt published booklet titled Badminton Battledore—A New Game copy survived. An 1863 article The Cornhill Magazine describes badminton "battledore shuttlecock played sides, string suspended feet ground".The game originally developed expatriate officers British India, popular 1870s. Ball badminton, game played wool ball shuttlecock, played Thanjavur 1850s played interchangeably badminton British, woollen ball preferred windy wet weather.Early on, game Poona Poonah garrison town Pune, popular rules game drawn 1873. By 1875, returning officers started badminton club Folkestone. Initially, sport played ranging 1–4 players established games competitors worked best. The shuttlecocks coated India rubber and, outdoor play, weighted lead. Although depth consequence, preferred reach ground.The sport played Pune rules 1887, J.H.E. Hart Bath Badminton Club drew revised regulations. In 1890, Hart Bagnel Wild revised rules. The Badminton Association England published rules 1893 officially launched sport house called "Dunbar" Portsmouth 13 September. The BAE started badminton competition, All England Open Badminton Championships gentlemen's doubles, ladies' doubles, mixed doubles, 1899. Singles competitions 1900 England—Ireland championship match appeared 1904.England, Scotland, Wales, Canada, Denmark, France, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand founding members International Badminton Federation 1934, Badminton World Federation. India joined affiliate 1936. The BWF governs international badminton. Although initiated England, competitive men's badminton traditionally dominated Europe Denmark. Worldwide, Asian nations international competition. China, Denmark, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea nations consistently produced world-class players decades, China greatest force men's women's competition recently. Rules The simplified summary badminton rules based BWF Statutes publication, Laws Badminton. Court The court rectangular divided halves net. Courts marked singles doubles play, badminton rules permit court marked singles only. The doubles court wider singles court, length. The exception, confusion newer players, doubles court shorter serve-length dimension.The width court 6.1 metres (20 ft), singles width reduced 5.18 metres (17 ft). The length court 13.4 metres (44 ft). The service courts marked centre dividing width court, short service distance 1.98 metres (6 6 inch) net, outer boundaries. In doubles, service court marked service line, 0.76 metres (2 6 inch) boundary.The 1.55 metres (5 1 inch) high edges 1.524 metres (5 ft) high centre. The posts doubles sidelines, singles played.The minimum height ceiling court mentioned Laws Badminton. Nonetheless, badminton court suitable ceiling high serve. Serving When server serves, shuttlecock pass short service opponents' court count fault.At start rally, server receiver stand diagonally opposite service courts (see court dimensions). The server hits shuttlecock land receiver's service court. This tennis, badminton serve waist height racquet shaft pointing downwards, shuttlecock allowed bounce badminton, players stand inside service courts tennis.When serving loses rally, serve passes opponent(s) (this differs system serve passes doubles partner "second serve").In singles, server stands service court score even, her/his left service court her/his score odd.In doubles, serving wins rally, player continues serve, he/she changes service courts she/he serves opponent time. If opponents rally score even, player service court serves; odd, player left service court serves. The players' service courts determined positions start rally, standing rally. A consequence system that, regains service, server player serve time. Scoring Each game played 21 points, players scoring point rally served (this differs system players point serve game played 15 points). A match best three games.If score reaches 20-all, game continues two-point lead (such 24–22), tie 29-all, game golden point. Whoever scores point win.At start match, shuttlecock cast shuttlecock pointing serves first. Alternatively, coin tossed, winners choosing serve receive first, choosing court occupy first, opponents making leftover remaining choice.In subsequent games, winners game serve first. Matches best three: player pair games (of 21 points each) match. For rally doubles game, serving pair decide serves receiving pair decide receives. The players change start second game; match reaches third game, change start game leading player's pair's score reaches 11 points.The server receiver remain service courts, touching boundary lines, server strikes shuttlecock. The players stand wish, block vision server receiver. Lets If called, rally stopped replayed change score. Lets occur unexpected disturbance shuttlecock landing court (having players playing adjacent court) small halls shuttle touch overhead rail classed let.If receiver service delivered, called; yet, receiver attempts return shuttlecock, receiver judged ready. Equipment Badminton rules restrict design size racquets shuttlecocks. Racquets Badminton racquets lightweight, quality racquets weighing 70 95 grams (2.5 3.4 ounces) including grip strings. They composed materials ranging carbon fibre composite (graphite reinforced plastic) solid steel, augmented variety materials. Carbon fibre excellent strength weight ratio, stiff, excellent kinetic energy transfer. Before adoption carbon fibre composite, racquets metals aluminum. Earlier still, racquets wood. Cheap racquets metals steel, wooden racquets longer manufactured ordinary market, excessive mass cost. Nowadays, nanomaterials fullerene carbon nanotubes racquets greater durability.There variety racquet designs, laws limit racquet size shape. Different racquets playing characteristics appeal players. The traditional oval head shape available, isometric head shape increasingly common racquets. Strings Badminton strings thin, high performing strings thicknesses ranging 0.62 0.73 mm. Thicker strings durable, players prefer feel thinner strings. String tension range 80 160 N (18 36 lbf). Recreational players generally string lower tensions professionals, typically 80 110 N (18 25 lbf). Professionals string 110 160 N (25 36 lbf). Some string manufacturers measure thickness strings tension thicker slack. Ashaway Micropower 0.7mm Yonex BG-66 0.72mm.It argued high string tensions improve control, string tensions increase power. The arguments generally crude mechanical reasoning, claiming lower tension string bed bouncy power. This fact incorrect, higher string tension shuttle slide racquet harder shot accurately. An alternative view suggests optimum tension power depends player: faster accurately player swing racquet, higher tension maximum power. Neither view subjected rigorous mechanical analysis, clear evidence favour other. The effective player find good string tension experiment. Grip The choice grip allows player increase thickness racquet handle choose comfortable surface hold. A player build handle grips applying final layer.Players choose variety grip materials. The common choices PU synthetic grips towelling grips. Grip choice matter personal preference. Players find sweat problem; case, drying agent applied grip hands, sweatbands used, player choose grip material change his/her grip frequently.There types grip: replacement grips overgrips. Replacement grips thicker, increase size handle. Overgrips thinner (less 1 mm), final layer. Many players, however, prefer replacement grips final layer. Towelling grips replacement grips. Replacement grips adhesive backing, overgrips small patch adhesive start tape applied tension; overgrips convenient players change grips frequently, removed rapidly damaging underlying material. Shuttlecock A shuttlecock (often abbreviated shuttle; called birdie) high-drag projectile, open conical shape: cone formed sixteen overlapping feathers embedded rounded cork base. The cork covered leather synthetic material. Synthetic shuttles recreational players reduce costs feathered shuttles break easily. These nylon shuttles constructed natural cork synthetic foam base, plastic skirt.Badminton rules testing shuttlecock correct speed:3.1: To test shuttlecock, underhand stroke contact shuttlecock boundary line. The shuttlecock upward angle direction parallel lines.3.2: A shuttlecock correct speed land 530 990 short boundary line. Shoes Badminton shoes lightweight soles rubber high-grip, non-marking materials.Compared running shoes, badminton shoes lateral support. High levels lateral support activities lateral motion undesirable unexpected. Badminton, however, requires powerful lateral movements. A highly built-up lateral support protect foot badminton; instead, encourage catastrophic collapse point shoe's support fails, player's ankles sudden loading, sprains. For reason, players choose badminton shoes general trainers running shoes, proper badminton shoes sole, lower person's centre gravity, fewer injuries. Players ensure learn safe proper footwork, knee foot alignment lunges. This safety concern: proper footwork critical order move effectively court. Technique Strokes Badminton offers variety basic strokes, players require high level skill perform effectively. All strokes played backhand. A player's playing hand: right-handed player, backhand left side. Forehand strokes front leading (like hitting palm), backhand strokes leading (like hitting knuckles). Players frequently play strokes backhand hitting action, vice versa.In forecourt midcourt, strokes played equally effectively backhand side; rear court, players attempt play strokes forehands, preferring play round-the-head overhead (a "on backhand side") attempt backhand overhead. Playing backhand overhead disadvantages. First, player turn opponents, restricting view court. Second, backhand overheads power forehands: hitting action limited shoulder joint, permits greater range movement overhead backhand. The backhand clear considered players coaches difficult basic stroke game, precise technique needed order muster power shuttlecock travel length court. For reason, backhand smashes weak. Position shuttlecock receiving player The choice stroke depends shuttlecock net, height, opponent currently positioned: players better attacking options reach shuttlecock well height, close net. In forecourt, high shuttlecock kill, hitting steeply attempting rally immediately. This best drop shuttlecock situation. In midcourt, high shuttlecock powerful smash, hitting hoping outright winner weak reply. Athletic jump smashes, players jump upwards steeper smash angle, common spectacular element elite men's doubles play. In rearcourt, players strive shuttlecock them, allowing drop lower. This overhead hitting allows play smashes, clears (hitting shuttlecock high opponents' court), drop shots (hitting shuttlecock softly falls sharply opponents' forecourt). If shuttlecock dropped lower, smash impossible full-length, high clear difficult. Vertical position shuttlecock When shuttlecock well height, players choice upwards. Lifts, shuttlecock upwards opponents' court, played parts court. If player lift, remaining option push shuttlecock softly net: forecourt called netshot; midcourt rearcourt, called push block.When shuttlecock height, players drives, travel flat rapidly opponents' rear midcourt rearcourt. Pushes flatter, placing shuttlecock front midcourt. Drives pushes played midcourt forecourt, doubles: attempt regain attack, choosing lift shuttlecock defend smashes. After drive push, opponents forced lift shuttlecock. Spin Balls spun alter bounce (for example, topspin backspin tennis) trajectory, players slice ball (strike angled racquet face) produce spin; but, shuttlecock allowed bounce, apply badminton.Slicing shuttlecock spins, however, applications, badminton. (See Basic strokes explanation technical terms.)Slicing shuttlecock travel direction direction suggested player's racquet movement. This deceive opponents.Slicing shuttlecock curved path (as above), deceleration imparted spin sliced strokes slow suddenly flight path. This create dropshots smashes dip steeply pass net.When playing netshot, slicing underneath shuttlecock turn (tumble) passes net. This called spinning netshot tumbling netshot. The opponent unwilling address shuttlecock corrected orientation.Due feathers overlap, shuttlecock natural spin axis rotational symmetry. The spin counter-clockwise direction dropping shuttlecock. This natural spin strokes: tumbling netshot effective slicing action left, left right. Biomechanics Badminton biomechanics subject extensive scientific study, studies confirm minor role wrist power generation indicate major contributions power internal external rotations upper lower arm. Recent guides sport emphasize forearm rotation wrist movements.The feathers impart drag, causing shuttlecock decelerate greatly distance. The shuttlecock extremely aerodynamically stable: initial orientation, turn cork-first, remain cork-first orientation.One consequence shuttlecock's drag requires considerable power length court, case racquet sports. The drag influences flight path lifted (lobbed) shuttlecock: parabola flight heavily skewed falls steeper angle rises. With high serves, shuttlecock fall vertically. Other factors When defending smash, players three basic options: lift, block, drive. In singles, block common reply. In doubles, lift safest option allows opponents continue smashing; blocks drives counter-attacking strokes, intercepted smasher's partner. Many players backhand hitting action returning smashes backhand sides, backhands effective forehands covering smashes directed body. Hard shots directed difficult defend.The service restricted Laws presents array stroke choices. Unlike tennis, server's racquet pointing direction deliver serve shuttle upwards pass net. The server choose serve forecourt (like push), lift service court, flat drive serve. Lifted serves high serves, shuttlecock lifted high falls vertically court, flick serves, shuttlecock lifted lesser height falls sooner. Deception Once players mastered basic strokes, shuttlecock court, powerfully softly required. Beyond basics, however, badminton offers rich advanced stroke skills competitive advantage. Because badminton players cover short distance possible, purpose advanced strokes deceive opponent, tricked believing stroke played, forced delay movement sees shuttle's direction. "Deception" badminton senses. When player genuinely deceived, lose point change direction reach shuttlecock. Experienced players aware trick cautious move early, attempted deception forces opponent delay movement slightly. Against weaker players intended strokes obvious, experienced player move shuttlecock hit, anticipating stroke advantage.Slicing shortened hitting action technical devices facilitate deception. Slicing involves hitting shuttlecock angled racquet face, causing travel direction suggested arm movement. Slicing shuttlecock travel slowly arm movement suggests. For example, good crosscourt sliced dropshot hitting action suggests straight clear smash, deceiving opponent power direction shuttlecock. A sophisticated slicing action involves brushing strings shuttlecock hit, order shuttlecock spin. This improve shuttle's trajectory, making dip rapidly passes net; example, sliced serve travel faster serve, land spot. Spinning shuttlecock create spinning netshots (also called tumbling netshots), shuttlecock turns (tumbles) stabilizing; shuttlecock remains inverted tumbling. The advantage spinning netshot opponent unwilling address shuttlecock stopped tumbling, hitting feathers unpredictable stroke. Spinning netshots high level singles players.The lightness modern racquets allows players short hitting action strokes, maintaining option powerful soft stroke moment. For example, singles player hold racquet netshot, flick shuttlecock shallow lift notices opponent moved shot played. A shallow lift takes reach ground mentioned rally shuttlecock touches ground. This opponent's task covering court difficult lift higher bigger, swing. A short hitting action deception: allows player powerful strokes big arm swing. A big arm swing advised badminton bigger swings difficult recover shot fast exchanges. The grip tightening crucial techniques, described finger power. Elite players develop finger power extent power strokes, kills, 10 centimetres (4 inches) racquet swing.It reverse style deception, suggesting powerful stroke slowing hitting action play soft stroke. In general, style deception common rearcourt (for example, dropshots disguised smashes), style common forecourt midcourt (for example, lifts disguised netshots).Deception limited slicing short hitting actions. Players double motion, initial racquet movement direction withdrawing racquet direction. Players send opponents wrong direction. The racquet movement typically straight angle play stroke court, vice versa. Triple motion possible, rare play. An alternative double motion racquet head fake, initial motion continued racquet turned hit. This produces smaller change direction, require time. Strategy To badminton, players employ variety strokes situations. These range powerful jumping smashes delicate tumbling returns. Often rallies finish smash, setting smash requires subtler strokes. For example, netshot force opponent lift shuttlecock, opportunity smash. If netshot tight tumbling, opponent's lift reach court, subsequent smash harder return.Deception important. Expert players prepare strokes identical, slicing deceive opponents speed direction stroke. If opponent anticipate stroke, move wrong direction unable change momentum reach shuttlecock. Singles Since person cover entire court, singles tactics based forcing opponent move possible; singles strokes directed corners court. Players exploit length court combining lifts clears drop shots shots. Smashing prominent singles doubles smasher partner effort vulnerable skillfully return. Moreover, frequent smashing exhausting singles conservation player's energy premium. However, players smashes shot create openings, players commonly smash weak returns rallies.In singles, players start rally high serve flick serve. Low serves frequently, backhand. Drive serves rare.At high levels play, singles demands extraordinary fitness. Singles game patient positional manoeuvring, all-out aggression doubles. Doubles Both pairs maintain attack, smashing opportunity arises. Whenever possible, pair ideal attacking player hitting rearcourt, partner midcourt intercepting smash returns lift. If rearcourt attacker plays dropshot, partner move forecourt threaten reply. If pair downwards, flat strokes attempt attack. If pair forced lift clear shuttlecock, defend: side-by-side position rear midcourt, cover width court opponents' smashes. In doubles, players generally smash middle ground players order advantage confusion clashes.At high levels play, backhand serve popular extent serves fairly rare high level play. The straight serve frequently, attempt prevent opponents gaining attack immediately. Flick serves prevent opponent anticipating serve attacking decisively.At high levels play, doubles rallies extremely fast. Men's doubles aggressive badminton, high proportion powerful jump smashes reflex exchanges. Because this, spectator interest greater men's doubles singles. Mixed Doubles In mixed doubles, pairs typically maintain attacking woman front back. This male players stronger, produce smashes powerful. As result, mixed doubles require greater tactical awareness subtler positional play. Clever opponents reverse ideal position, forcing woman front. In order protect danger, mixed players careful systematic shot selection.At high levels play, formations generally flexible: women players capable playing powerfully back-court, happily required. When opportunity arises, however, pair switch standard mixed attacking position, woman front men back.

Finance field deals study investments. It includes dynamics assets liabilities conditions degrees uncertainty risk. Finance defined science money management. Finance aims price assets based risk level expected rate return. Finance broken three sub-categories: public finance, corporate finance personal finance. Areas finance Personal finance Questions personal finance revolve around:Protection unforeseen personal events, well events wider economiesTransference family wealth generations (bequests inheritance)Effects tax policies (tax subsidies penalties) management personal financesEffects credit individual financial standingDevelopment savings plan financing purchases (auto, education, home)Planning secure financial future environment economic instabilityPersonal finance involve paying education, financing durable goods estate cars, buying insurance, e.g. health property insurance, investing saving retirement.Personal finance involve paying loan, debt obligations. The areas personal financial planning, suggested Financial Planning Standards Board, are:Financial position: concerned understanding personal resources examining worth household cash flow. Net worth person's balance sheet, calculated adding assets person's control, minus liabilities household, point time. Household cash flow totals expected sources income year, minus expected expenses year. From analysis, financial planner determine degree personal goals accomplished.Adequate protection: analysis protect household unforeseen risks. These risks divided following: liability, property, death, disability, health term care. Some risks self-insurable, require purchase insurance contract. Determining insurance get, cost effective terms requires knowledge market personal insurance. Business owners, professionals, athletes entertainers require specialized insurance professionals adequately protect themselves. Since insurance enjoys tax benefits, utilizing insurance investment products critical piece investment planning.Tax planning: typically income tax single largest expense household. Managing taxes question pay taxes, much. Government incentives tax deductions credits, reduce lifetime tax burden. Most modern governments progressive tax. Typically, one's income grows, higher marginal rate tax paid. Understanding advantage myriad tax breaks planning one's personal finances impact save money term.Investment accumulation goals: planning accumulate money purchases life events people consider financial planning. Major reasons accumulate assets include, purchasing house car, starting business, paying education expenses, saving retirement. Achieving goals requires projecting cost, withdraw funds achieve goals. A major risk household achieving accumulation goal rate price increases time, inflation. Using calculators, financial planner combination asset earmarking regular savings invested variety investments. In order overcome rate inflation, investment portfolio higher rate return, typically subject portfolio number risks. Managing portfolio risks accomplished asset allocation, seeks diversify investment risk opportunity. This asset allocation prescribe percentage allocation invested stocks (either preferred stock common stock), bonds (for example mutual bonds government bonds, corporate bonds), cash alternative investments. The allocation consideration personal risk profile investor, risk attitudes vary person person.Retirement planning process understanding costs live retirement, plan distribute assets meet income shortfall. Methods retirement plan include advantage government allowed structures manage tax liability including: individual (IRA) structures, employer sponsored retirement plans.Estate planning involves planning disposition one's assets death. Typically, tax federal government one's death. Avoiding taxes one's assets distributed one's heirs. One leave one's assets family, friends charitable groups. Corporate finance Corporate finance deals sources funding capital structure corporations, actions managers increase firm shareholders, tools analysis allocate financial resources. Although principle managerial finance studies financial management firms, corporations alone, concepts study corporate finance applicable financial problems kinds firms. Corporate finance generally involves balancing risk profitability, attempting maximize entity's assets, incoming cash flow stock, generically entails three primary areas capital resource allocation. In first, "capital budgeting", management choose "projects" (if any) undertake. The discipline capital budgeting employ standard business valuation techniques extend options valuation; Financial modeling. The second, "sources capital" relates investments funded: investment capital provided sources, shareholders, equity (privately initial public offering), creditors, bonds, firm's operations (cash flow). Short-term funding working capital provided banks extending credit. The balance elements forms company's capital structure. The third, "the dividend policy", requires management determine unappropriated profit (excess cash) retained future investment / operational requirements, distributed shareholders, so, form. Short term financial management termed "working capital management", relates cash-, inventory- debtors management.Corporate finance includes scope business valuation, stock investing, investment management. An investment acquisition asset hope maintain increase hope higher rate return disbursing dividends. In investment management – choosing portfolio – financial analysis determine what, invest. To this, company must:Identify relevant objectives constraints: institution individual goals, horizon, risk aversion tax considerations;Identify appropriate strategy: active versus passive hedging strategyMeasure portfolio performanceFinancial management overlaps financial function accounting profession. However, financial accounting reporting historical financial information, financial management concerned allocation capital resources increase firm's shareholders increase rate return investments.Financial risk management, element corporate finance, practice creating protecting economic firm financial instruments manage exposure risk, credit risk market risk. (Other risk types include foreign exchange, shape, volatility, sector, liquidity, inflation risks, etc.) It focuses hedge financial instruments; sense overlaps financial engineering. Similar general risk management, financial risk management requires identifying sources, measuring (see: Risk measure: Well risk measures), formulating plans address these, qualitative quantitative. In banking sector worldwide, Basel Accords generally internationally active banks tracking, reporting exposing operational, credit market risks. Financial services An entity income exceeds expenditure lend invest excess income help excess income produce income future. Though hand, entity income expenditure raise capital borrowing selling equity claims, decreasing expenses, increasing income. The lender find borrower—a financial intermediary bank—or buy notes bonds (corporate bonds, government bonds, mutual bonds) bond market. The lender receives interest, borrower pays higher interest lender receives, financial intermediary earns difference arranging loan.A bank aggregates activities borrowers lenders. A bank accepts deposits lenders, pays interest. The bank lends deposits borrowers. Banks allow borrowers lenders, sizes, coordinate activity.Finance individuals (personal finance), governments (public finance), businesses (corporate finance) variety organizations schools non-profit organizations. In general, goals activities achieved appropriate financial instruments methodologies, consideration institutional setting.Finance aspects business management includes analysis acquisition funds enterprise.In corporate finance, company's capital structure total mix financing methods raise funds. One method debt financing, includes bank loans bond sales. Another method equity financing sale stock company investors, original shareholders (they portion business) share. Ownership share shareholder contractual rights powers, typically include receive declared dividends vote proxy matters (e.g., board elections). The owners bonds (either government bonds corporate bonds) stock (whether preferred stock common stock), institutional investors financial institutions investment banks pension funds private individuals, called private investors retail investors. Public finance Public finance describes finance sovereign sub-national entities (states/provinces, counties, municipalities, etc.) public entities (e.g. school districts) agencies. It encompasses long-term, strategic perspective investment decisions public entities. These long-term, strategic periods encompass years. Public finance concerned with:Identification required expenditure public sector entitySource(s) entity's revenueThe budgeting processDebt issuance (municipal bonds) public works projectsCentral banks, Federal Reserve System banks United States Bank England United Kingdom, players public finance, acting lenders resort well influences monetary credit conditions economy. Capital Capital, financial sense, money business power buy goods production goods offering service. (The capital types resources, Equity Debt).The deployment capital decided budget. This include objective business, targets set, financial terms, e.g., target set sale, cost, growth, required investment achieve planned sales, financing source investment.A budget term short term. Long term budgets horizon 5–10 years vision company; short term annual budget drawn control operate year.Budgets include proposed fixed asset requirements expenditures financed. Capital budgets adjusted annually (done year) longer-term Capital Improvements Plan.A cash budget required. The working capital requirements business monitored ensure funds meet short-term expenses.The cash budget basically detailed plan expected sources cash spending appropriately. The cash budget sections:Beginning Cash Balance period's closing cash balance, words, remaining cash years earnings.Cash collections includes expected cash receipts (all sources cash period considered, sales)Cash disbursements lists planned cash outflows period dividend, excluding interest payments short-term loans, appear financing section. All expenses cash flow excluded list (e.g. depreciation, amortization, etc.)Cash excess deficiency function cash cash available. Cash determined total cash disbursements minimum cash balance required company policy. If total cash cash needs, deficiency exists.Financing discloses planned borrowings repayments planned borrowings, including interest. Financial theory Financial economics Financial economics branch economics studying interrelation financial variables, prices, interest rates shares, opposed goods services. Financial economics concentrates influences economic variables financial ones, contrast pure finance. It centres managing risk context financial markets, resultant economic financial models. It essentially explores rational investors apply risk return problem investment policy. Here, twin assumptions rationality market efficiency lead modern portfolio theory (the CAPM), Black–Scholes theory option valuation; studies phenomena models assumptions hold, extended. "Financial economics", formally, considers investment "certainty" (Fisher separation theorem, "theory investment value", Modigliani–Miller theorem) contributes corporate finance theory. Financial econometrics branch financial economics econometric techniques parameterize relationships suggested.Although closely related, disciplines economics finance distinctive. The “economy” social institution organizes society’s production, distribution, consumption goods services, financed.Economists number abstract assumptions purposes analyses predictions. They generally financial markets function financial system efficient mechanism (Efficient-market hypothesis). Instead, financial markets subject human error emotion. New discloses mischaracterization investment safety measures financial products markets complex effects, conditions uncertainty, impossible predict. The study finance subsumed economics financial economics, scope, speed, power relations practices financial system uplift cripple economies well-being households, businesses governing bodies them—sometimes single day. Financial mathematics Financial mathematics field applied mathematics, concerned financial markets. The subject close relationship discipline financial economics, concerned underlying theory involved financial mathematics. Generally, mathematical finance derive, extend, mathematical numerical models suggested financial economics. In terms practice, mathematical finance overlaps heavily field computational finance (also financial engineering). Arguably, synonymous, focuses application, focuses modelling derivation (see: Quantitative analyst). The field focused modelling derivatives, subfields include insurance mathematics quantitative portfolio problems. See Outline finance: Mathematical tools; Outline finance: Derivatives pricing. Experimental finance Experimental finance aims establish market settings environments observe experimentally lens science analyze agents' behavior characteristics trading flows, diffusion aggregation, price setting mechanisms, returns processes. Researchers experimental finance study extent existing financial economics theory valid predictions prove them, attempt discover principles theory extended applied future financial decisions. Research proceed conducting trading simulations establishing studying behavior, people react, people artificial competitive market-like settings.

An engine motor machine designed convert energy mechanical energy. Heat engines burn fuel create heat, create force. Electric motors convert electrical energy mechanical motion; pneumatic motors compressed air clockwork motors wind-up toys elastic energy. In biological systems, molecular motors, myosins muscles, chemical energy create forces eventually motion. Terminology The engine derives Old French engin, Latin ingenium–the root ingenious. Pre-industrial weapons war, catapults, trebuchets battering rams, called siege engines, knowledge construct treated military secret. The gin, cotton gin, short engine. Most mechanical devices invented industrial revolution described engines—the steam engine notable example. However, original steam engines, Thomas Savery, mechanical engines pumps. In manner, fire engine original water pump, engine transported fire horses.In modern usage, term engine typically describes devices, steam engines internal combustion engines, burn consume fuel perform mechanical work exerting torque linear force (usually thrust). Devices converting heat energy motion commonly referred simply engines. Examples engines exert torque include familiar automobile gasoline diesel engines, well turboshafts. Examples engines produce thrust include turbofans rockets.When internal combustion engine invented, term motor initially distinguish steam engine—which time, powering locomotives vehicles steam rollers. The term motor derives Latin verb moto set motion, maintain motion. Thus motor device imparts motion.Motor engine interchangeably casual discourse. However, technically, meanings. An engine device burns consumes fuel, changing chemical composition, motor device driven electricity, air, hydraulic pressure, change chemical composition energy source. However, rocketry term rocket motor, consume fuel.A heat engine serve prime mover—a component transforms flow changes pressure fluid mechanical energy. An automobile powered internal combustion engine motors pumps, ultimately devices derive power engine. Another motor receives power external source, converts mechanical energy, engine creates power pressure (derived directly explosive force combustion chemical reaction, secondarily action force substances air, water, steam). History Antiquity Simple machines, club oar (examples lever), prehistoric. More complex engines human power, animal power, water power, wind power steam power antiquity. Human power focused simple engines, capstan, windlass treadmill, ropes, pulleys, block tackle arrangements; power transmitted forces multiplied speed reduced. These cranes aboard ships Ancient Greece, well mines, water pumps siege engines Ancient Rome. The writers times, including Vitruvius, Frontinus Pliny Elder, treat engines commonplace, ancient. By 1st century AD, cattle horses mills, driving machines powered humans earlier times.According Strabo, water powered built Kaberia kingdom Mithridates 1st century BC. Use water wheels mills spread Roman Empire centuries. Some complex, aqueducts, dams, sluices maintain channel water, systems gears, toothed-wheels wood metal regulate speed rotation. More sophisticated small devices, Antikythera Mechanism complex trains gears dials calendars predict astronomical events. In poem Ausonius 4th century AD, mentions stone-cutting powered water. Hero Alexandria credited wind steam powered machines 1st century AD, including Aeolipile vending machine, machines associated worship, animated altars automated temple doors. Medieval Medieval Muslim engineers employed gears mills water-raising machines, dams source water power additional power watermills water-raising machines. In medieval Islamic world, advances mechanize industrial tasks carried manual labour.In 1206, al-Jazari employed crank-conrod system water-raising machines. A rudimentary steam turbine device described Taqi al-Din 1551 Giovanni Branca 1629.In 13th century, solid rocket motor invented China. Driven gunpowder, this, simplest internal combustion engine unable deliver sustained power, propelling weaponry high speeds enemies battle fireworks. After invention, innovation spread Europe. Industrial Revolution The Watt steam engine type steam engine steam pressure atmospheric drive piston helped partial vacuum. Improving design 1712 Newcomen steam engine, Watt steam engine, developed sporadically 1763 1775, great step development steam engine. Offering dramatic increase fuel efficiency, James Watt's design synonymous steam engines, small business partner, Matthew Boulton. It enabled rapid development efficient semi-automated factories unimaginable scale places waterpower available. Later development led steam locomotives great expansion railway transportation.As internal combustion piston engines, tested France 1807 Rivaz independently, Niépce brothers. They theoretically advanced Carnot 1824. In 1853-57 Eugenio Barsanti Felice Matteucci invented patented engine free-piston principle 4-cycle engine.The internal combustion engine commercially 1860 Etienne Lenoir. The Otto cycle 1877 capable higher power weight ratio steam engines worked better transportation applications cars aircraft. Automobiles The commercially automobile, created Karl Benz, interest powerful engines. The lightweight petrol internal combustion engine, operating four-stroke Otto cycle, automobiles, efficient Diesel engine trucks buses. However, years, turbo Diesel engines increasingly popular, United States, small cars. Horizontally opposed pistons In 1896, Karl Benz granted patent design engine horizontally opposed pistons. His design created engine corresponding pistons move horizontal cylinders reach dead center simultaneously, automatically balancing individual momentum. Engines design referred flat engines shape lower profile. They Volkswagen Beetle, Porsche Subaru cars, BMW Honda motorcycles, aircraft engines (for propeller driven aircraft). Advancement Continuance internal combustion engine automobiles partly improvement engine control systems (onboard computers providing engine management processes, electronically controlled fuel injection). Forced air induction turbocharging supercharging increased power outputs engine efficiencies. Similar changes applied smaller diesel engines power characteristics petrol engines. This evident popularity smaller diesel engine propelled cars Europe. Larger diesel engines trucks heavy machinery, require machining factories. Diesel engines produce lower hydrocarbon CO2 emissions, greater particulate NOx pollution, gasoline engines. Diesel engines 40% fuel efficient comparable gasoline engines. Increasing power The half 20th century trend increasing engine power, American models. Design changes incorporated methods raising engine capacity, including increasing pressure cylinders improve efficiency, increasing size engine, increasing rate engine produces work. The higher forces pressures created changes created engine vibration size problems led stiffer, compact engines V opposed cylinder layouts replacing longer straight-line arrangements. Combustion efficiency The design principles favoured Europe, economic restraints smaller twistier roads, leant smaller cars corresponding design principles concentrated increasing combustion efficiency smaller engines. This produced economical engines earlier four-cylinder designs rated 40 horsepower (30 kW) six-cylinder designs rated 80 horsepower (60 kW), compared volume V-8 American engines power ratings range 250 350 hp, 400 hp (190 260 kW). Engine configuration Earlier automobile engine development produced larger range engines common today. Engines ranged 1- 16-cylinder designs corresponding differences size, weight, engine displacement, cylinder bores. Four cylinders power ratings 19 120 hp (14 90 kW) majority models. Several three-cylinder, two-stroke-cycle models built engines straight in-line cylinders. There V-type models horizontally opposed two- four-cylinder too. Overhead camshafts frequently employed. The smaller engines commonly air-cooled located rear vehicle; compression ratios low. The 1970s 1980s increased interest improved fuel economy, caused return smaller V-6 four-cylinder layouts, valves cylinder improve efficiency. The Bugatti Veyron 16.4 operates W16 engine, meaning V8 cylinder layouts positioned create W shape sharing crankshaft.The largest internal combustion engine built Wärtsilä-Sulzer RTA96-C, 14-cylinder, 2-stroke turbocharged diesel engine designed power Emma Mærsk, largest container ship world. This engine weighs 2,300 tons, running 102 RPM produces 109,000 bhp (80,080 kW) consuming 13.7 tons fuel hour. Types An engine category criteria: energy accepts order create motion, type motion outputs. Heat engine Combustion engine Combustion engines heat engines driven heat combustion process. Internal combustion engine The internal combustion engine engine combustion fuel (generally, fossil fuel) occurs oxidizer (usually air) combustion chamber. In internal combustion engine expansion high temperature high pressure gases, produced combustion, directly applies force components engine, pistons turbine blades nozzle, moving distance, generates mechanical energy. External combustion engine An external combustion engine (EC engine) heat engine internal working fluid heated combustion external source, engine wall heat exchanger. The fluid then, expanding acting mechanism engine produces motion usable work. The fluid cooled, compressed reused (closed cycle), (less commonly) dumped, cool fluid pulled (open cycle air engine)."Combustion" refers burning fuel oxidizer, supply heat. Engines (or identical) configuration operation supply heat sources nuclear, solar, geothermal exothermic reactions involving combustion; strictly classed external combustion engines, external thermal engines.The working fluid gas Stirling engine, steam steam engine organic liquid n-pentane Organic Rankine cycle. The fluid composition; gas common, single-phase liquid used. In case steam engine, fluid changes phases liquid gas. Air-breathing combustion engines Air-breathing combustion engines combustion engines oxygen atmospheric air oxidise ('burn') fuel, carrying oxidiser, rocket. Theoretically, better impulse rocket engines.A continuous stream air flows air-breathing engine. This air compressed, mixed fuel, ignited expelled exhaust gas.ExamplesTypical air-breathing engines include:Reciprocating engineSteam engineGas turbineairbreathing jet engineTurbo-propeller enginePulse detonation enginePulse jetRamjetScramjetLiquid air cycle engine/Reaction Engines SABRE. Environmental effects The operation engines typically negative impact air quality ambient sound levels. There growing emphasis pollution producing features automotive power systems. This created interest alternate power sources internal-combustion engine refinements. Though limited-production battery-powered electric vehicles appeared, proved competitive costs operating characteristics. In 21st century diesel engine increasing popularity automobile owners. However, gasoline engine Diesel engine, emission-control devices improve emission performance, challenged. A number manufacturers introduced hybrid engines, involving small gasoline engine coupled electric motor battery bank, inroad market shares gasoline Diesel engines. Air quality Exhaust spark ignition engine consists following: nitrogen 70 75% (by volume), water vapor 10 12%, carbon dioxide 10 13.5%, hydrogen 0.5 2%, oxygen 0.2 2%, carbon monoxide: 0.1 6%, unburnt hydrocarbons partial oxidation products (e.g. aldehydes) 0.5 1%, nitrogen monoxide 0.01 0.4%, nitrous oxide <100 ppm, sulfur dioxide 15 60 ppm, traces compounds fuel additives lubricants, halogen metallic compounds, particles. Carbon monoxide highly toxic, carbon monoxide poisoning, avoid build-up gas confined space. Catalytic converters reduce toxic emissions, completely eliminate them. Also, greenhouse gas emissions, chiefly carbon dioxide, widespread engines modern industrialized contributing global greenhouse – primary concern global warming. Non-combusting heat engines Some engines convert heat noncombustive processes mechanical work, example nuclear power plant heat nuclear reaction produce steam drive steam engine, gas turbine rocket engine driven decomposing hydrogen peroxide. Apart energy source, engine engineered internal external combustion engine. Another group noncombustive engines includes thermoacoustic heat engines (sometimes called "TA engines") thermoacoustic devices high-amplitude sound waves pump heat another, conversely heat difference induce high-amplitude sound waves. In general, thermoacoustic engines divided standing wave travelling wave devices. Non-thermal chemically powered motor Non-thermal motors powered chemical reaction, heat engines. Examples include:Molecular motor motors living thingsSynthetic molecular motor. Electric motor An electric motor electrical energy produce mechanical energy, interaction magnetic fields current-carrying conductors. The reverse process, producing electrical energy mechanical energy, accomplished generator dynamo. Traction motors vehicles perform tasks. Electric motors generators vice versa, practical. Electric motors ubiquitous, applications diverse industrial fans, blowers pumps, machine tools, household appliances, power tools, disk drives. They powered direct current (for example battery powered portable device motor vehicle), alternating current central electrical distribution grid. The smallest motors electric wristwatches. Medium-size motors highly standardized dimensions characteristics convenient mechanical power industrial uses. The largest electric motors propulsion ships, purposes pipeline compressors, ratings thousands kilowatts. Electric motors classified source electric power, internal construction, application.The physical principle production mechanical force interactions electric current magnetic field 1821. Electric motors increasing efficiency constructed 19th century, commercial exploitation electric motors scale required efficient electrical generators electrical distribution networks.To reduce electric energy consumption motors associated carbon footprints, regulatory authorities countries introduced implemented legislation encourage manufacture higher efficiency electric motors. A well-designed motor convert 90% input energy power decades. When efficiency motor raised percentage points, savings, kilowatt hours (and cost), enormous. The electrical energy efficiency typical industrial induction motor improved by: 1) reducing electrical losses stator windings (e.g., increasing cross-sectional area conductor, improving winding technique, materials higher electrical conductivities, copper), 2) reducing electrical losses rotor coil casting (e.g., materials higher electrical conductivities, copper), 3) reducing magnetic losses better quality magnetic steel, 4) improving aerodynamics motors reduce mechanical windage losses, 5) improving bearings reduce friction losses, 6) minimizing manufacturing tolerances. For discussion subject, Premium efficiency.)By convention, electric engine refers railroad electric locomotive, electric motor. Physically powered motor Some motors powered kinetic energy, example funiculars, gravity plane ropeway conveyors energy moving water rocks, clocks weight falls gravity. Other forms energy include compressed gases (such pneumatic motors), springs (clockwork motors) elastic bands.Historic military siege engines included catapults, trebuchets, (to extent) battering rams powered energy. Pneumatic motor A pneumatic motor machine converts energy compressed air mechanical work. Pneumatic motors generally convert compressed air mechanical work linear rotary motion. Linear motion diaphragm piston actuator, rotary motion supplied vane type air motor piston air motor. Pneumatic motors widespread hand-held tool industry continual attempts expand transportation industry. However, pneumatic motors overcome efficiency deficiencies viable option transportation industry. Hydraulic motor A hydraulic motor derives power pressurized fluid. This type engine move heavy loads produce motion. Performance Engine speed In case engines outputting shaft power, engine speed measured revolutions minute (RPM). Engines classified low-speed, medium-speed high-speed terms inexact depend type engine described. Generally, diesel engines operate lower speed compared gasoline engines. Electric motors turboshafts capable high speeds. In case engines producing thrust, inaccurate talk 'engine speed' moving engine, working medium engine accelerating; case talks exhaust velocity, exactly Isp gravitational field jump straight discussion efficiency; article impulse information. Thrust Thrust force arising interaction masses exert equal opposite forces speed. The force F measured newtons (N, SI units) pounds-thrust (lbf, imperial units). Torque Torque force exerted theoretical lever connected output shaft engine. This expressed formula: τ | × F | F ⁡ ( , F ) {\displaystyle \tau |{\mathbf {r}}\times {\mathbf {F}}|rF\sin({\mathbf {r}},{\mathbf {F}})} length lever, F force applied it, r×F vector product. Torque measured typically newton-metres (N·m, SI units) foot-pounds (ft·lb, imperial units). Power Power amount work done, energy produced, unit time. This expressed formula: P W {\displaystyle P{\frac {\mathrm {d} W}{\mathrm {d} t}}} With demonstration, that: P F ⋅ {\displaystyle P{\mathbf {F}}\cdot {\mathbf {v}}} This formula linear forces speeds equally well engines outputting thrust engines exerting torque.When considering propulsive engines, typically raw force core mass flow considered, leading engines 'power' rated units discussed forces.If engine question outputs power shaft, then: P τ ω {\displaystyle P\tau \omega } .This reason engine outputting power rotating shaft quoted, rated power, rotational speed rated power developed. Efficiency Depending type engine employed, rates efficiency attained.For heat engines, efficiency greater Carnot efficiency. Sound levels In case sound levels, engine operation greatest impact mobile sources automobiles trucks. Engine noise component mobile source noise vehicles operating lower speeds, aerodynamic tire noise significant. Generally speaking, petrol diesel engines emit noise turboshafts equivalent power output; electric motors emit noise fossil fuel-powered equivalents. Thrust-outputting engines, turbofans, turbojets rockets emit greatest amount noise method producing thrust directly production sound. Various methods devised reduce noise. Petrol diesel engines fitted mufflers (silencers); newer turbofans outsized fans (the so-called high-bypass technology) order reduce proportion noisy, hot exhaust integrated turboshaft exhaust stream, hushkits exist older, low-bypass turbofans. No methods exist reducing noise output rockets corresponding reduction thrust.

Poker family card games combine gambling, strategy, skill . All poker variants involve betting intrinsic play, determine winner combinations players' cards, remain hidden hand. Poker games vary number cards dealt, number shared "community" cards, number cards remain hidden, betting procedures pokertogelmania.In modern poker games, betting players making forced (the blind ante). In standard poker, player bets rank worth compared players. The action proceeds clockwise player turn match, "call", maximum fold, losing amount interest hand. A player matches "raise", increase bet. The betting players called folded. If player folds round, remaining player collects required reveal hand. If player remains contention final betting round, showdown takes hands revealed, player winning takes pot.With exception initial forced bets, money voluntarily player believes positive expected bluff players strategic reasons. Thus, outcome involves chance, long-run expectations players determined actions chosen basis probability, psychology, game theory.Poker gained popularity twentieth century recreational activity confined small groups enthusiasts popular activity, participants spectators, including online, professional players multimillion-dollar tournament prizes. History 19th century In 1937 edition Foster's Complete Hoyle, R. F. Foster wrote: "the game poker, played United States, cards player twenty-card pack, undoubtedly Persian game As-Nas. By 1990s gaming historians including David Parlett started challenge notion poker direct derivative As-Nas. There evidence game called poque, French game poker, played region poker originated. The game descended Irish Poca (Pron. Pokah) ('Pocket') French poque, descended German pochen ('to brag bluff' lit. 'to knock'). Yet clear origins poker games bearing names. It commonly regarded sharing ancestry Renaissance game primero French brelan. The English game brag (earlier bragg) clearly descended brelan incorporated bluffing (though concept games time). It earlier games influenced development poker exists now.A modern school thought rejects ancestries, focus card play poker, trivial derived number games general cardplay principles. The unique features poker betting, appear older game. In view poker originated later, mid-18th century, spread Mississippi River region 1800. It played variety forms, 52 cards, included straight poker stud. 20 card poker variant players (it common English practice reduce deck card games fewer players). The development poker linked historical movement commercial gambling.English actor Joseph Crowell reported game played New Orleans 1829, deck 20 cards, players betting player's valuable. Jonathan H. Green's book, An Exposure Arts Miseries Gambling (G. B. Zieber, Philadelphia, 1843), described spread game rest country Mississippi riverboats, gambling common pastime.

Practitioners accounting accountants. The terms "accounting" "financial reporting" synonyms.Accounting divided fields including financial accounting, management accounting, external auditing, tax accounting. Accounting systems designed support accounting functions activities. Financial accounting focuses reporting organization's financial information, including preparation financial statements, external users information, investors, regulators suppliers; management accounting focuses measurement, analysis reporting internal management. The recording financial transactions, summaries financials presented financial reports, bookkeeping, double-entry bookkeeping common system.Accounting facilitated accounting organizations standard-setters, accounting firms professional bodies. Financial statements audited accounting firms, prepared generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). GAAP set standard-setting organizations Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) United States Financial Reporting Council United Kingdom. As 2012, "all major economies" plans converge International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). History The history accounting thousands years traced ancient civilizations. The development accounting dates ancient Mesopotamia, closely developments writing, counting money; evidence forms bookkeeping ancient Iran, auditing systems ancient Egyptians Babylonians. By Emperor Augustus, Roman government access detailed financial information.Double-entry bookkeeping developed medieval Europe, accounting split financial accounting management accounting development joint-stock companies. The work double-entry bookkeeping system published Italy, Luca Pacioli. Accounting began transition organized profession nineteenth century, local professional bodies England merging Institute Chartered Accountants England Wales 1880. Etymology Both accounting accountancy Great Britain mid-1800s, derived accompting accountantship 18th century. In Middle English (used roughly 12th 15th century) verb "to account" accounten, derived Old French aconter, turn Vulgar Latin computare, meaning "to reckon". The base computare putare, "variously prune, purify, correct account, hence, count calculate, well think."The "accountant" derived French compter, derived Italian Latin computare. The written English "accomptant", process word, pronounced dropping "p", gradually changed pronunciation orthography form. Accounting accountancy Accounting variously defined keeping preparation financial records entity, analysis, verification reporting records "the principles procedures accounting"; refers job accountant.Accountancy refers occupation profession accountant, British English. Topics Accounting subfields subject areas, including financial accounting, management accounting, auditing, taxation accounting systems. Financial accounting Financial accounting focuses reporting organization's financial external users information, investors, potencial investors creditors. It calculates records business transactions prepares financial statements external users generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

This includes images display real-time viewing.Despite differences, 3D computer graphics algorithms 2D computer graphics frame raster graphics (like 2D) final rendered display. In computer graphics software, distinction 2D 3D occasionally blurred; 2D applications 3D techniques achieve effects lighting, 3D 2D rendering techniques.3D computer graphics 3D models. The model contained graphical data file, apart rendering. However, differences include 3D model representation 3D object. Until visually displayed model graphic. Due printing, 3D models confined virtual space. 3D rendering model displayed. Also non-graphical computer simulations calculations. Computer animation Computer animation creating moving images computers. It subfield computer graphics animation. Increasingly created 3D computer graphics, 2D computer graphics stylistic, bandwidth, faster real-time rendering needs. Sometimes target animation computer itself, target medium, film. It referred CGI (Computer-generated imagery computer-generated imaging), films.Virtual entities controlled assorted attributes, transform values (location, orientation, scale) stored object's transformation matrix. Animation change attribute time. Multiple methods achieving animation exist; rudimentary based creation editing keyframes, storing time, attribute animated. The 2D/3D graphics software change keyframe, creating editable curve mapped time, animation. Other methods animation include procedural expression-based techniques: consolidates elements animated entities sets attributes, creating particle effects crowd simulations; allows evaluated returned user-defined logical expression, coupled mathematics, automate animation predictable (convenient controlling bone behavior hierarchy offers skeletal system set up).To create illusion movement, image displayed computer screen replaced image image, shifted slightly. This technique identical illusion movement television motion pictures. Concepts principles Images typically created devices cameras, mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes, etc.Digital images include vector images raster images, raster images commonly used. Pixel In digital imaging, pixel (or picture element) single point raster image. Pixels regular 2-dimensional grid, represented dots squares. Each pixel sample original image, samples typically accurate representation original. The intensity pixel variable; color systems, pixel typically three components red, green, blue.Graphics visual presentations surface, computer screen. Examples photographs, drawing, graphics designs, maps, engineering drawings, [[image]]s. Graphics combine text illustration. Graphic design consist deliberate selection, creation, arrangement typography alone, brochure, flier, poster, web site, book element. Clarity effective communication objective, association cultural elements sought, merely, creation distinctive style. Primitives Primitives basic units graphics system combine create complex images models. Examples sprites character maps 2d video games, geometric primitives CAD, polygons triangles 3d rendering. Primitives supported hardware efficient rendering, building blocks provided graphics application. Rendering Rendering generation 2D image 3D model computer programs. A scene file objects strictly defined language data structure; geometry, viewpoint, texture, lighting, shading description virtual scene. The data contained scene file passed rendering program processed output digital image raster graphics image file. The rendering program built computer graphics software, plug-ins entirely separate programs. The term "rendering" analogy "artist's rendering" scene. Though technical details rendering methods vary, general challenges overcome producing 2D image 3D representation stored scene file outlined graphics pipeline rendering device, GPU. A GPU device assist CPU calculations. If scene realistic predictable virtual lighting, rendering software solve rendering equation. The rendering equation account lighting phenomena, general lighting model computer-generated imagery. 'Rendering' describe process calculating effects video editing file produce final video output.3D projection3D projection method mapping three dimensional points dimensional plane. As current methods displaying graphical data based planar dimensional media, type projection widespread, computer graphics, engineering drafting.Ray tracingRay tracing technique generating image tracing path pixels image plane. The technique capable producing high degree photorealism; higher typical scanline rendering methods, greater computational cost.ShadingShading refers depicting depth 3D models illustrations varying levels darkness. It process drawing depicting levels darkness paper applying densely darker shade darker areas, densely lighter shade lighter areas. There techniques shading including hatching perpendicular lines varying closeness drawn grid pattern shade area. The closer lines together, darker area appears. Likewise, farther apart lines are, lighter area appears. The term generalized shaders applied.Texture mappingTexture mapping method adding detail, surface texture, colour computer-generated graphic 3D model. Its application 3D graphics pioneered Dr Edwin Catmull 1974. A texture map applied (mapped) surface shape, polygon. This process applying patterned paper plain white box. Multitexturing texture polygon. Procedural textures (created adjusting parameters underlying algorithm produces output texture), bitmap textures (created image editing application imported digital camera) are, generally speaking, common methods implementing texture definition 3D models computer graphics software, intended placement textures model's surface requires technique UV mapping (arbitrary, manual layout texture coordinates) polygon surfaces, NURBS surfaces intrinsic parameterization texture coordinates. Texture mapping discipline encompasses techniques creating maps bump maps correspond texture simulate height specular maps help simulate shine reflections, well environment mapping simulate mirror-like reflectivity, called gloss.Anti-aliasingRendering resolution-independent entities (such 3D models) viewing raster (pixel-based) device liquid-crystal display CRT television inevitably aliasing artifacts geometric edges boundaries texture details; artifacts informally called "jaggies". Anti-aliasing methods rectify problems, imagery pleasing viewer, computationally expensive. Various anti-aliasing algorithms (such supersampling) employed, customized efficient rendering performance versus quality resultant imagery; graphics artist consider trade-off anti-aliasing methods used. A pre-anti-aliased bitmap texture displayed screen (or screen location) resolution resolution texture (such textured model distance virtual camera) exhibit aliasing artifacts, procedurally defined texture aliasing artifacts resolution-independent; techniques mipmapping texture filtering help solve texture-related aliasing problems. Volume rendering Volume rendering technique display 2D projection 3D discretely sampled data set. A typical 3D data set group 2D slice images acquired CT MRI scanner.Usually acquired regular pattern (e.g., slice millimeter) regular number image pixels regular pattern. This example regular volumetric grid, volume element, voxel represented single sampling area surrounding voxel. 3D modeling 3D modeling process developing mathematical, wireframe representation three-dimensional object, called "3D model", specialized software. Models created automatically manually; manual modeling process preparing geometric data 3D computer graphics plastic arts sculpting. 3D models created multiple approaches: NURBS curves generate accurate smooth surface patches, polygonal mesh modeling (manipulation faceted geometry), polygonal mesh subdivision (advanced tessellation polygons, smooth surfaces NURBS models). A 3D model displayed two-dimensional image process called 3D rendering, computer simulation physical phenomena, animated directly purposes. The model physically created 3D Printing devices.

Volleyball team sport teams players separated net. Each team score points grounding ball team's court organized rules. It official program Summer Olympic Games 1964.The complete rules extensive. But simply, play proceeds follows: player teams 'rally' serving ball (tossing releasing hitting arm), boundary court, net, receiving team's court. The receiving team ball grounded court. The team touch ball 3 individual players touch ball consecutively. Typically, touches set attack, attempt direct ball serving team unable prevent grounded court.The rally continues, team allowed three consecutive touches, (1): team kill, grounding ball opponent's court winning rally; (2): team commits fault loses rally. The team wins rally awarded point, serves ball start rally. A common faults include:causing ball touch ground floor opponents' court passing net;catching throwing ball;double hit: consecutive contacts ball player;four consecutive contacts ball team;net foul: touching play;foot fault: foot crosses boundary serving.The ball played hands arms, players legally strike push (short contact) ball body.A number consistent techniques evolved volleyball, including spiking blocking (because plays net, vertical jump athletic skill emphasized sport) well passing, setting, specialized player positions offensive defensive structures. History Origin volleyball On February 9, 1895, Holyoke, Massachusetts (USA), William G. Morgan, YMCA physical education director, created game called Mintonette pastime played (preferably) indoors number players. The game characteristics tennis handball. Another indoor sport, basketball, catching area, invented miles (sixteen kilometers) city Springfield, Massachusetts, years before. Mintonette designed indoor sport, basketball, older members YMCA, requiring bit athletic effort.The rules, written William G Morgan, called 6 6 (1.98 m) high, 25 × 50 (7.6 × 15.2 m) court, number players. A match composed three serves team inning, limit number ball contacts team sending ball opponents' court. In case serving error, second allowed. Hitting ball considered foul (with loss point side-out)—except case first-try serve.After observer, Alfred Halstead, noticed volleying nature game exhibition match 1896, played International YMCA Training School (now called Springfield College), game volleyball (it originally spelled words: "volley ball"). Volleyball rules modified International YMCA Training School game spread country YMCAs. Refinements developments The official ball volleyball disputed; sources Spalding created official ball 1896, claim created 1900. The rules evolved time: Philippines 1916, skill power set spike introduced, years "three hits" rule rule hitting row established. In 1917, game changed 21 15 points. In 1919, 16,000 volleyballs distributed American Expeditionary Forces troops allies, sparked growth volleyball countries.The country United States volleyball Canada 1900. An international federation, Fédération Internationale Volleyball (FIVB), founded 1947, World Championships held 1949 men 1952 women. The sport popular Brazil, Europe (where Italy, Netherlands, countries Eastern Europe major forces 1980s), Russia, countries including China rest Asia, well United States.Beach volleyball, variation game played players team, FIVB-endorsed variation 1987 Olympic program 1996 Summer Olympics. Volleyball sport Paralympics managed World Organization Volleyball Disabled.Nudists adopters game regular organized play clubs 1920s. By 1960s, volleyball court standard nudist/naturist clubs. Volleyball Olympics The history Olympic volleyball traces 1924 Summer Olympics Paris, volleyball played American sports demonstration event. After foundation FIVB continental confederations, began considered official inclusion. In 1957, tournament held 53rd IOC session Sofia, Bulgaria support request. The competition success, sport officially included program 1964 Summer Olympics.The Olympic volleyball tournament originally simple competition: teams played team ranked wins, set average, point average. One disadvantage round-robin system medal winners determined games, making audience lose interest outcome remaining matches. To cope situation, competition split phases addition "final round" elimination tournament consisting quarterfinals, semifinals, finals matches 1972. The number teams involved Olympic tournament grown steadily 1964. Since 1996, men's women's events count twelve participant nations. Each continental volleyball confederations affiliated national federation involved Olympic Games.The U.S.S.R. men's gold 1964 1968. After bronze 1964 silver 1968, Japan finally gold men's volleyball 1972. Women's gold Japan 1964 1976. That year, introduction offensive skill, backrow attack, allowed Poland men's competition Soviets tight five-set match. Since strongest teams men's volleyball belonged Eastern Bloc, American-led boycott 1980 Summer Olympics great events women's. The U.S.S.R. collected third Olympic Gold Medal men's volleyball 3–1 victory Bulgaria (the Soviet women year well, third gold well). With U.S.S.R. boycotting 1984 Olympic Games Los Angeles, U.S. sweep Brazil finals men's gold medal. Italy medal (bronze men's competition) 1984, foreshadowing prominence volleyball teams. The 1984 women's tournament rising force, China.At 1988 Games, Karch Kiraly Steve Timmons led U.S. men's team second straight gold medal, Soviets fourth gold women's tournament. In 1992, underrated Brazil upset favourites C.I.S., Netherlands, Italy men's competition country's volleyball Olympic gold medal. Runner-up Netherlands, men's silver medalist 1992, team leaders Ron Zwerver Olof van Meulen 1996 Games five-set Italy. A men's bronze medalist 1996, Serbia Montenegro (playing 1996 2000 Federal Republic Yugoslavia) beat Russia gold medal match 2000, winning gold medal ever. In three games Cuban female team led Regla Torres Mireya Luis Gold medal. In 2004, Brazil second men's volleyball gold medal beating Italy finals, China beat Russia second women's title. In 2008 Games, USA beat Brazil men's volleyball final. Brazil runner-up 2012 Summer Olympics, losing Russia losing match points third set. In games Brazil's women team beat United States gold medal. Rules game The court dimensions A volleyball court 9 × 18 (29.53 × 59.06 ft), divided equal square halves width meter (39.4 in). The 2.43 (7 11 21⁄32 in) center court men's competition, 2.24 (7 4 3⁄16 in) women's competition, varied veterans junior competitions.The minimum height clearance indoor volleyball courts 7 (23 ft), clearance 8 (26 ft) recommended.A 3 (9.84 ft) parallel considered "attack line". This "3 meter" (or "10-foot") divides court "back row" "front row" areas (also court front court). These turn divided 3 areas each: numbered follows, starting area "1", position serving player:After team serve (also siding out), members rotate clockwise direction, player area "2" moving area "1" on, player area "1" moving area "6". Each player rotates team possession serve; player rotates team wins possession ball loses point.The team courts surrounded area called free zone minimum 3 meters players enter play service ball. All lines denoting boundaries team court attack zone drawn painted dimensions area court zone. If ball contact line, ball considered "in". An antenna perpendicular sideline vertical extension boundary court. A ball passing pass completely antenna (or theoretical extensions ceiling) contacting them. The ball FIVB regulations ball spherical, leather synthetic leather, circumference 65–67 cm, weight 260–280 inside pressure 0.30–0.325 kg/cm2. Other governing bodies regulations. Game play Each team consists players. To play started, team chosen serve coin toss. A player serving team throws ball air attempts ball passes course land opposing team's court (the serve). The opposing team combination three contacts volleyball return ball opponent's net. These contacts consist bump pass ball's trajectory aimed player designated setter; second set (usually over-hand pass wrists push finger-tips ball) setter ball's trajectory aimed spot players designated attacker it, third attacker spikes (jumping, raising arm head hitting ball move ground opponent's court) return ball net. The team possession ball attack ball described offense.The team defense attempts prevent attacker directing ball court: players jump reach (and possible, plane) block attacked ball. If ball around, above, block, defensive players arranged rest court attempt control ball dig (usually fore-arm pass hard-driven ball). After dig, team transitions offense.The game continues manner, rallying forth, ball touches court boundaries error made. The frequent errors fail return ball allowed three touches, ball land court. A ball "in" touches sideline end-line, spike compress ball lands ball appears going in. Players travel well court play ball sideline end-line air.Other common errors include player touching ball succession, player "catching" ball, player touching attempting play ball, player penetrating opponent's court. There number errors rules, infrequent occurrences. These errors include back-row libero players spiking ball blocking (back-row players spike ball jump attack line), players correct position ball served, attacking serve front court height net, player source support reach ball, stepping boundary serving, 8 seconds serve, playing ball opponent's court. Scoring When ball contacts floor court boundaries error made, team error awarded point, served ball not. If ball hits line, ball counted in. The team point serves point. If team point served point, player serves again. If team point serve point, players serving team rotate position court clockwise manner. The game continues, team score 25 points two-point margin awarded set. Matches best-of-five sets set, necessary, played 15 points. (Scoring differs leagues, tournaments, levels; high schools play best-of-three 25; NCAA matches played best-of-five 25 2008 season.)Before 1999, points scored team serve (side-out scoring) sets 15 points. The FIVB changed rules 1999 (with changes compulsory 2000) current scoring system (formerly rally point system), length match predictable game spectator- television-friendly.The final year side-out scoring NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Championship 2000. Rally point scoring debuted 2001, games played 30 points 2007. For 2008 season, games renamed "sets" reduced 25 points win. Most high schools U.S. changed rally scoring 2003, implemented year experimental basis. Libero The libero player introduced internationally 1998, debut NCAA competition 2002. The libero player specialized defensive skills: libero wear contrasting jersey color teammates block attack ball entirely height. When ball play, libero replace back-row player, prior notice officials. This replacement count substitution limit team allowed set, libero replaced player replaced. Most U.S. high schools libero position 2003 2005.The libero function setter restrictions. If she/he overhand set, she/he standing (and stepping on) 3-meter line; otherwise, ball attacked front 3-meter line. An underhand pass allowed court.The libero is, generally, skilled defensive player team. There libero tracking sheet, referees officiating team track libero for. There libero set (game), libero set (game).Furthermore, libero allowed serve, international rules, exception NCAA women's volleyball games, 2004 rule change allows libero serve, rotation. That is, libero serve person, people in. That rule change applied high school junior high play after. Recent rule changes Other rule changes enacted 2000 include allowing serves ball touches net, opponents' court. Also, service area expanded allow players serve theoretical extension sidelines. Other changes lighten calls faults carries double-touches, allowing multiple contacts single player ("double-hits") team's contact provided single play ball.In 2008, NCAA changed minimum number points needed sets 30 25 women's volleyball (men's volleyball remained 30.) If (deciding) set reached, minimum required score remains 15. In addition, "game" referred "set".Changes rules studied announced FIVB years, released updated rules 2009. Skills Competitive teams master basic skills: serve, pass, set, attack, block dig. Each skills comprises number techniques introduced years considered standard practice high-level volleyball. Serve A player stands inline serves ball, attempt drive opponent's court. The objective land inside court; desirable set ball's direction, speed acceleration difficult receiver handle properly. A serve called "ace" ball lands directly court travels court touched opponent.In contemporary volleyball, types serves employed:Underhand: serve player strikes ball waist tossing striking overhand throwing motion. Underhand serves considered easy receive rarely employed high-level competitions.Sky ball serve: type underhand serve occasionally beach volleyball, ball high straight line. This serve invented employed exclusively Brazilian team 1980s considered outdated. During 2016 Olympic Games Rio Janeiro, however, sky ball serve extensively played Italian beach volleyball player Adrian Carambula. In Brazil, serve called Jornada nas Estrelas (Star Trek)Topspin: overhand serve player tosses ball high hits wrist span, topspin drop faster helps maintain straight flight path. Topspin serves generally aimed returner court. Standing topspin serves rarely high school level play.Float: overhand serve ball spin path unpredictable, knuckleball baseball.Jump serve: overhand serve ball tossed high air, player timed approach jumps contact ball, hitting pace topspin. This popular serve college professional teams.Jump float: overhand serve ball tossed high player jump hitting standing float serve. The ball tossed lower topspin jump serve, contact air. This serve popular college professional players unpredictability flight pattern. It serve server's feet inline. Pass Also called reception, pass attempt team properly handle opponent's serve, attack. Proper handling includes preventing ball touching court, making reach position setter standing precisely.The skill passing involves fundamentally techniques: underarm pass, bump, ball touches inside joined forearms platform, waist line; overhand pass, handled fingertips, set, head. Either acceptable professional beach volleyball, tighter regulations overhand pass beach volleyball. Set The set second contact team ball. The goal setting ball air driven attack opponent's court. The setter coordinates offensive movements team, player ultimately decides player attack ball.As passing, distinguish overhand bump set. Since allows control speed direction ball, bump ball properly handled fingertips, beach volleyball rules regulating overhand setting stringent. In case set, speaks front set, meaning ball passed direction setter facing setter. There jump set ball close net. In case setter jumps foot straight avoid going net. The setter stands ⅔ left faces left (the larger portion see).Sometimes setter refrains raising ball teammate perform attack play directly opponent's court. This movement called "dump". This performed setter front row, constitutes illegal court attack. The common dumps 'throw' ball setter front setter zones 2 4. More experienced setters toss ball deep corners spike ball second hit.As set overhand pass, setter/passer careful touch ball hands time. If noticeably touch ball effective set, well referee calling 'double hit' point opposing team. Attack The attack, spike, third contact team ball. The object attacking handle ball lands opponent's court defended. A player series steps (the "approach"), jumps, swings ball.Ideally contact ball apex hitter's jump. At moment contact, hitter's arm extended head forward, making highest contact maintaining ability deliver powerful hit. The hitter arm swing, wrist snap, rapid forward contraction entire drive ball. A 'bounce' slang term hard/loud spike straight trajectory steeply opponent's court bounces high air. A "kill" slang term attack returned team point.Contemporary volleyball comprises number attacking techniques:Backcourt (or backrow)/pipe attack: attack performed row player. The player jump 3-meter making contact ball, land front 3-meter line.Line Cross-court Shot: refers ball flies straight trajectory parallel lines, crosses court angle. A cross-court shot pronounced angle, ball landing 3-meter line, called cut shot.Dip/Dink/Tip/Cheat/Dump: player hit, touches ball lightly, lands area opponent's court covered defense.Tool/Wipe/Block-abuse: player spike, hits ball touches opponent's block bounces off-court.Off-speed hit: player ball hard, reducing speed confusing opponent's defense.Quick hit/"One": attack (usually middle blocker) approach jump setter contacts ball. The set (called "quick set") ball struck hitter leaving setter's hands. Quick attacks effective isolate middle blocker blocker hit.Slide: variation set. The middle hitter steps setter hits her.Double hit/"Stack"/"Tandem": variation hitters, front setter front setter, jump perform time. It deceive opposite blockers free fourth hitter attacking back-court, block all. Block Blocking refers actions players standing alter opponent's attack.A block aimed completely stopping attack, making ball remain opponent's court, called offensive. A well-executed offensive block performed jumping reaching penetrate one's arms hands opponent's area. It requires anticipating direction ball attack takes place. It require calculating best foot work executing "perfect" block.The jump timed intercept ball's trajectory prior crossing net. Palms held deflected 45–60 degrees interior opponents court. A "roof" spectacular offensive block redirects power speed attack straight attacker's floor, attacker ball underside peaked house roof.By contrast, called defensive, "soft" block goal control deflect hard-driven ball slows easier defend. A well-executed soft-block performed jumping placing one's hands penetration opponent's court palms fingers pointing backward.Blocking classified number players involved. Thus, speak single (or solo), double, triple block.Successful blocking "roof" touch ball. While block attacker roofed, block consistently forces attacker 'power' preferred attack easily controlled shot defense highly block.At time, block position influences positions defenders opponent hitters spiking. Dig Digging ability prevent ball touching one's court spike attack, ball touching ground. In aspects, skill passing, bumping: overhand dig bump distinguish defensive actions fingertips joined arms. It varies passing reflex based skill, higher levels. It digging players stay toes; players choose employ split step they're move direction.Some techniques common digging passing. A player perform "dive", i.e., throw air forward movement attempt save ball, land chest. When player slides ball touching court, called "pancake". The pancake frequently indoor volleyball, rarely beach volleyball uneven yielding nature court limits chances ball good, clean contact hand. When correctly, spectacular defensive volleyball plays.Sometimes player forced drop floor save ball. In situation, player rolling technique minimize chances injuries. Team play Volleyball essentially game transition skills next, choreographed team movement plays ball. These team movements determined teams chosen serve receive system, offensive system, coverage system, defensive system.The serve receive system receiving team attempt pass ball designated setter. Systems consist 5 receivers, 4 receivers, 3 receivers, cases 2 receivers. The popular higher levels 3 receiver consisting left libero receiving rotation. This allows middles specialized hitting blocking.Offensive systems formations offense attempt ground ball opposing court (or score points). Formations include designated player positions skill specialization (see Player specialization, below). Popular formations include 4-2, 6-2, 5-1 systems (see Formations, below). There attacking schemes teams opposing defense balance.Coverage systems formations offense protect court case blocked attack. Executed 5 offensive players directly attacking ball, players move assigned positions attacker dig ball deflects block court. Popular formations include 2-3 system 1-2-2 system. In lieu system, teams random coverage players nearest hitter.Defensive systems formations defense protect ball grounded court opposing team. The system outline players responsible areas court depending opposing team attacking from. Popular systems include 6-Up, 6-Back-Deep, 6-Back-Slide defense. There blocking schemes teams employ disrupt opposing teams offense.Some teams, serve, players screen obscure view receiving team. This action illegal server screen, referees discretion impact screen receivers ability pass ball. The common style screening involves W designed horizontal space possible. Coaching Basic Coaching volleyball classified categories: match coaching developmental coaching. The objective match coaching match managing team's strategy. Developmental coaching emphasizes player development reinforcement basic skills exercises "drills." Drills promote repetition refinement volleyball movements, footwork patterns, positioning others, ball contact. A coach construct drills simulate match situations encouraging speed movement, anticipation, timing, communication, team-work. At stages player's career, coach tailor drills meet strategic requirements team. The American Volleyball Coaches Association largest organization dedicated exclusively volleyball coaching. Strategy Player specialization There 5 positions filled volleyball team elite level. Setter, Outside Hitter/Left Side Hitter, Middle Hitter, Opposite Hitter/Right Side Hitter Libero/Defensive Specialist. Each positions plays specific, role winning volleyball match.Setters task orchestrating offense team. They aim second touch responsibility ball air attackers ball opponents' court point. They operate hitters, manage tempo court choose attackers set. Setters swift skillful appraisal tactical accuracy, moving court.Liberos defensive players responsible receiving attack serve. They players court quickest reaction best passing skills. Libero 'free' Italian—they receive ability substitute player court play. They tall, play net, allows shorter players passing defensive skills excel position play role team's success. A player designated libero match play roles match. Liberos wear color jersey teammates.Middle blockers Middle hitters players perform fast attacks setter. They specialized blocking, attempt equally fast plays opponents set double block court. In non-beginners play, team middle hitters.Outside hitters Left hitters attack left antenna. The hitter consistent hitter team sets. Inaccurate passes set hitter middle opposite. Since sets high, hitter longer approach, starting court sideline. In non-beginners play, hitters team match.Opposite hitters Right-side hitters carry defensive workload volleyball team front row. Their primary responsibilities well formed block opponents' Outside Hitters serve backup setter. Sets opposite antennae.At levels substitutions unlimited, teams Defensive Specialist addition Libero. This position unique rules libero position, instead, players substitute row defender regular substitution rules. A defensive specialist court defender left side, team libero middles. Most often, situation involves team player big block subbed row aren't effectively play court defense. Similarly, teams Serving Specialist server situationally. Formations The three standard volleyball formations "4–2", "6–2" "5–1", refers number hitters setters respectively. 4–2 basic beginners' play, 5–1 common high-level play. 4–2 The 4–2 hitters setters. The setters set middle front front position. The team front-row attackers times. In international 4–2, setters set front position. The international 4–2 translates easily forms offense.The setters opposite rotation. The typical lineup hitters. By aligning positions opposite rotation, position front rows. After service, players front row move assigned positions, setter middle front. Alternatively, setter moves front middle attacker; disadvantage lies lack offside hitter, allowing team's blockers "cheat in" middle block.The clear disadvantage offensive attackers, leaving team fewer offensive weapons.Another aspect setter attacking force, albeit weakened force, setter front court 'tip' 'dump', ball close second touch, setter ball hand. This blocker block setter engaged allow hitters easier attack. 6–2 In 6–2 formation, player forward row set. The three front row players attacking positions. Thus, players hitters another, setters. So 6–2 4–2 system, back-row setter penetrates set.The 6–2 lineup requires setters, opposite rotation. In addition setters, typical lineup middle hitters hitters. By aligning positions opposite rotation, position front rows. After service, players front row move assigned positions.The advantage 6–2 three front-row hitters available, maximizing offensive possibilities. However, 6–2 require team possess people capable performing highly specialized role setter, requires players effective offensive hitters setter position. At international level, Cuban National Women's Team employs kind formation. It Women's NCAA play, partially variant rules allow 12 substitutions set (as opposed 6 allowed standard rules). 5–1 The 5–1 player assumes setting responsibilities position rotation. The team three front-row attackers setter row, setter front row, total attackers.The player opposite setter 5–1 rotation called opposite hitter. In general, opposite hitters pass; stand teammates opponent serving. The opposite hitter third attack option (back-row attack) setter front row: option increase attack capabilities modern volleyball teams. Normally opposite hitter technical skilled hitter team. Back-row attacks generally back-right position, zone 1, increasingly performed back-center high-level play.The big advantage system setter 3 hitters vary sets with. If setter well, opponent's middle blocker block blocker, increasing chance attacking team point.There advantage, 4–2 formation: setter front-row player, allowed jump "dump" ball opponent's side. This confuse opponent's blocking players: setter jump dump set hitters.

Hockey family sports teams play maneuver ball puck opponent's goal hockey stick. In areas, sport (typically field hockey hockey) generally referred simply "hockey". Etymology The recorded hockey 1773 book Juvenile Sports Pastimes, Which Are Prefixed, Memoirs Author: Including New Mode Infant Education Richard Johnson (Pseud. Master Michel Angelo), chapter XI titled "New Improvements Game Hockey". The belief hockey mentioned 1363 proclamation King Edward III England based modern translations proclamation, originally Latin explicitly forbade games "Pilam Manualem, Pedivam, & Bacularem: & Canibucam & Gallorum Pugnam". The English historian biographer John Strype "hockey" translated proclamation 1720.The hockey unknown origin. One supposition derivative hoquet, Middle French shepherd's stave. The curved, "hooked" sticks hockey resembled staves. Another supposition derives cork bungs, (stoppers) wooden balls play game. The stoppers barrels "hock" ale, called "hocky". History Games played curved sticks ball histories cultures. In Egypt, 4000-year-old carvings feature teams sticks projectile, hurling dates 1272 BC Ireland, depiction 600 BC Ancient Greece, game called kerētízein (κερητίζειν) played horn horn-like stick (kéras, κέρας).

A fuel material react substances releases chemical nuclear energy heat work. The concept originally applied solely materials capable releasing chemical energy applied sources heat energy nuclear energy (via nuclear fission nuclear fusion).The heat energy released reactions fuels converted mechanical energy heat engine. Other heat valued warmth, cooking, industrial processes, well illumination combustion. Fuels cells organisms process cellular respiration, organic molecules oxidized release usable energy. Hydrocarbons oxygen-containing molecules common source fuel humans, substances, including radioactive metals, utilized.Fuels contrasted substances devices storing energy, directly release electrical energy (such batteries capacitors) mechanical energy (such flywheels, springs, compressed air, water reservoir). History The fuel combustion wood sticks Homo erectus 2,000,000 (two million) years ago. Throughout human history fuels derived plants animal fat humans. Charcoal, wood derivative, 6,000 BCE melting metals. It supplanted coke, derived coal, European forests started depleted 18th century. Charcoal briquettes commonly fuel barbecue cooking.Coal fuel 1000 BCE China. With energy chemical energy released combustion, concept development steam engine United Kingdom 1769, coal common power source. Coal drive ships locomotives. By 19th century, gas extracted coal street lighting London. In 20th 21st centuries, primary coal generate electricity, providing 40% world's electrical power supply 2005.Fossil fuels rapidly industrial revolution, concentrated flexible traditional energy sources, water power. They pivotal contemporary society, countries burning fossil fuels order produce power.Currently trend renewable fuels, biofuels alcohols. Chemical Chemical fuels substances release energy reacting substances them, notably process combustion. Most chemical energy released combustion stored chemical bonds fuel, weak double bond molecular oxygen.Chemical fuels divided ways. First, physical properties, solid, liquid gas. Secondly, basis occurrence: primary (natural fuel) secondary (artificial fuel). Thus, general classification chemical fuels is: Solid fuel Solid fuel refers types solid material fuel produce energy heating, released combustion. Solid fuels include wood (see wood fuel), charcoal, peat, coal, Hexamine fuel tablets, pellets wood (see wood pellets), corn, wheat, rye grains. Solid-fuel rocket technology solid fuel (see solid propellants). Solid fuels humanity years create fire. Coal fuel source enabled industrial revolution, firing furnaces, running steam engines. Wood extensively steam locomotives. Both peat coal electricity generation today. The solid fuels (e.g. coal) restricted prohibited urban areas, unsafe levels toxic emissions. The solid fuels wood decreasing heating technology availability good quality fuel improves. In areas, smokeless coal solid fuel used. In Ireland, peat briquettes smokeless fuel. They start coal fire. Liquid fuels Liquid fuels combustible energy-generating molecules harnessed create mechanical energy, producing kinetic energy; shape container. It fumes liquid fuels flammable fluid.Most liquid fuels widespread derived fossilized remains dead plants animals exposure heat pressure Earth's crust. However, types, hydrogen fuel (for automotive uses), ethanol, jet fuel biodiesel categorized liquid fuel. Emulsified fuels oil-in-water orimulsion developed heavy oil fractions usable liquid fuels. Many liquid fuels play primary role transportation economy.Some common properties liquid fuels easy transport, handled ease. Also easy engineering applications, use. Fuels kerosene rationed countries, example government subsidized shops India use.Conventional diesel gasoline mixture aliphatic hydrocarbons extracted petroleum. Kerosene kerosene lamps fuel cooking, heating, small engines. Natural gas, composed chiefly methane, exist liquid temperatures (regardless pressure), limits direct liquid fuel applications. LP gas mixture propane butane, easily compressible gases standard atmospheric conditions. It offers advantages compressed natural gas (CNG), denser air, burn cleanly, easily compressed. Commonly cooking space heating, LP gas compressed propane increased motorized vehicles; propane third commonly motor fuel globally. Gaseous fuels Fuel gas number fuels ordinary conditions gaseous. Many fuel gases composed hydrocarbons (such methane propane), hydrogen, carbon monoxide, mixtures thereof. Such gases sources heat energy energy transmitted distributed pipes point origin directly consumption. Fuel gas contrasted liquid fuels solid fuels, fuel gases liquefied storage transport. While gaseous nature advantageous, avoiding difficulty transporting solid fuel dangers spillage inherent liquid fuels, dangerous. It fuel gas undetected collect areas, leading risk gas explosion. For reason, odorizers fuel gases detected distinct smell. The common type fuel gas current natural gas. Biofuels Biofuel broadly defined solid, liquid, gas fuel consisting of, derived biomass. Biomass directly heating power—known biomass fuel. Biofuel produced carbon source replenished rapidly e.g. plants. Many plants plant-derived materials biofuel manufacture.Perhaps earliest fuel employed humans wood. Evidence controlled fire 1.5 years ago Swartkrans, South Africa. It unknown hominid species fire, Australopithecus species Homo sites. As fuel, wood remained day, superseded purposes sources. Wood energy density 10–20 MJ/kg.Recently biofuels developed automotive transport (for example Bioethanol Biodiesel), widespread public debate carbon efficient fuels are. Fossil fuels Fossil fuels hydrocarbons, coal petroleum (liquid petroleum natural gas), formed fossilized remains ancient plants animals exposure high heat pressure absence oxygen Earth's crust hundreds millions years. Commonly, term fossil fuel includes hydrocarbon-containing natural resources derived entirely biological sources, tar sands. These sources properly mineral fuels.Fossil fuels high percentages carbon include coal, petroleum, natural gas. They range volatile materials carbon:hydrogen ratios methane, liquid petroleum nonvolatile materials composed pure carbon, anthracite coal. Methane hydrocarbon fields, alone, associated oil, methane clathrates. Fossil fuels formed fossilized remains dead plants exposure heat pressure Earth's crust millions years. This biogenic theory introduced German scholar Georg Agricola 1556 Mikhail Lomonosov 18th century.It estimated Energy Information Administration 2007 primary sources energy consisted petroleum 36.0%, coal 27.4%, natural gas 23.0%, amounting 86.4% share fossil fuels primary energy consumption world. Non-fossil sources 2006 included hydroelectric 6.3%, nuclear 8.5%, (geothermal, solar, tidal, wind, wood, waste) amounting 0.9%. World energy consumption growing 2.3% year.Fossil fuels non-renewable resources millions years form, reserves depleted faster made. So conserve fuels judiciously. The production fossil fuels raise environmental concerns. A global movement generation renewable energy help meet increased energy needs. The burning fossil fuels produces 21.3 billion tonnes (21.3 gigatonnes) carbon dioxide (CO2) year, estimated natural processes absorb half amount, increase 10.65 billion tonnes atmospheric carbon dioxide year (one tonne atmospheric carbon equivalent 44/12 3.7 tonnes carbon dioxide). Carbon dioxide greenhouse gases enhances radiative forcing contributes global warming, causing average surface temperature Earth response, vast majority climate scientists agree major adverse effects. Fuels source energy. Energy The amount energy types fuel depends stoichiometric ratio, chemically correct air fuel ratio ensure complete combustion fuel, Specific energy, energy unit mass.1 MJ ≈ 0.28 kWh ≈ 0.37 HPh. Nuclear Nuclear fuel material consumed derive nuclear energy. Technically speaking, All matter nuclear fuel element conditions release nuclear energy, materials commonly referred nuclear fuels produce energy extreme duress. Nuclear fuel material 'burned' nuclear fission fusion derive nuclear energy. Nuclear fuel refer fuel itself, physical objects (for example bundles composed fuel rods) composed fuel material, mixed structural, neutron moderating, neutron reflecting materials.Most nuclear fuels heavy fissile elements capable nuclear fission. When fuels struck neutrons, turn capable emitting neutrons break apart. This self-sustaining chain reaction releases energy controlled rate nuclear reactor rapid uncontrolled rate nuclear weapon.The common fissile nuclear fuels uranium-235 (235U) plutonium-239 (239Pu). The actions mining, refining, purifying, using, ultimately disposing nuclear fuel nuclear fuel cycle. Not types nuclear fuels create power nuclear fission. Plutonium-238 elements produce small amounts nuclear power radioactive decay radioisotope thermoelectric generators types atomic batteries. Also, nuclides tritium (3H) fuel nuclear fusion. Nuclear fuel highest energy density practical fuel sources. Fission The common type nuclear fuel humans heavy fissile elements undergo nuclear fission chain reactions nuclear fission reactor; nuclear fuel refer material physical objects (for example fuel bundles composed fuel rods) composed fuel material, mixed structural, neutron moderating, neutron reflecting materials. The common fissile nuclear fuels 235U 239Pu, actions mining, refining, purifying, using, ultimately disposing elements nuclear fuel cycle, relevance nuclear power generation nuclear weapons. Fusion Fuels produce energy process nuclear fusion currently utilized humans source fuel stars. Fusion fuels elements hydrogen combine easily. Energy required start fusion raising temperature high materials turn plasma, allow nuclei collide stick repelling electric charge. This process called fusion energy.In stars undergo nuclear fusion, fuel consists atomic nuclei release energy absorption proton neutron. In stars fuel provided hydrogen, combine helium proton-proton chain reaction CNO cycle. When hydrogen fuel exhausted, nuclear fusion continue progressively heavier elements, energy released lower smaller difference nuclear binding energy. Once iron-56 nickel-56 nuclei produced, energy nuclear fusion highest nuclear binding energies. The elements energy energy fused. Therefore, fusion stops star dies. In attempts humans, fusion carried hydrogen (isotope 2 3) helium-4 reaction energy. Electric confinement (ITER), inertial confinement(heating laser) heating electric currents popular methods used. .

Table tennis, ping pong, sport players lightweight ball table small bat. The game takes table divided net. Except initial serve, rules generally follows: players allow ball played bounce table, return bounces opposite once. A point scored player fails return ball rules. Play fast demands reactions. Spinning ball alters trajectory limits opponent's options, hitter great advantage.Table tennis governed worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), founded 1926. ITTF currently includes 220 member associations. The table tennis official rules ITTF handbook. Table tennis Olympic sport 1988, event categories. From 1988 2004, men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles women's doubles. Since 2008, team event played doubles. History The sport originated Victorian England, played upper-class after-dinner parlour game. It suggested makeshift versions game developed British military officers India 1860s 1870s, brought them. A row books stood center table net, books served rackets continuously golf-ball.It names, including 'whiff-whaff'. The "ping-pong" British manufacturer J. Jaques & Son Ltd trademarked 1901. The "ping-pong" describe game played expensive Jaques's equipment, manufacturers calling table tennis. A situation arose United States, Jaques sold rights "ping-pong" Parker Brothers. Parker Brothers enforced trademark term 1920s making associations change names "table tennis" common, trademarked, term.The major innovation James W. Gibb, British enthusiast table tennis, discovered novelty celluloid balls trip US 1901 ideal game. This E.C. Goode who, 1901, invented modern version racket fixing sheet pimpled, stippled, rubber wooden blade. Table tennis growing popularity 1901 extent tournaments organized, books written subject, unofficial championship held 1902.In 1921, Table Tennis Association founded Britain, International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) 1926. London hosted official World Championships 1926. In 1933, United States Table Tennis Association, called USA Table Tennis, formed.In 1930s, Edgar Snow commented Red Star Over China Communist forces Chinese Civil War "passion English game table tennis" "bizarre". On hand, popularity sport waned 1930s Soviet Union, partly promotion team military sports, partly theory game adverse health effects.In 1950s, paddles rubber sheet combined underlying sponge layer changed game dramatically, introducing greater spin speed. These introduced Britain sports goods manufacturer S.W. Hancock Ltd. The speed glue increased spin speed further, changes equipment "slow game down". Table tennis introduced Olympic sport Olympics 1988. Rule changes After 2000 Olympics Sydney, ITTF instituted rule changes aimed making table tennis viable televised spectator sport. First, older 38 (1.50 in) balls officially replaced 40 (1.57 in) balls October 2000. This increased ball's air resistance effectively slowed game. By time, players begun increasing thickness fast sponge layer paddles, game excessively fast difficult watch television. A months later, ITTF changed 21-point 11-point scoring system (and serve rotation reduced points two), effective September 2001. This intended games fast-paced exciting. The ITTF changed rules service prevent player hiding ball service, order increase average length rallies reduce server's advantage, effective 2002. For opponent realize serve place, ball tossed minimum 16 cm air. The ITTF events July 2014 played poly material ball. Equipment Ball The international rules game played sphere mass 2.7 grams (0.095 oz) diameter 40 millimetres (1.57 in). The rules ball bounce 24–26 cm (9.4–10.2 in) dropped height 30.5 cm (12.0 in) standard steel block coefficient restitution 0.89 0.92. The ball celluloid plastic 2015, colored white orange, matte finish. The choice ball color table color surroundings. For example, white ball easier green blue table grey table. Manufacturers indicate quality ball star rating system, three, three highest grade. As system standard manufacturers, ball official competition ITTF approval (the ITTF approval printed ball).The 40 ball introduced 2000 Summer Olympics. However, created controversy Chinese National Team argued non-Chinese players better chance winning type ball slower speed (a 40 table tennis ball slower spins original 38 one, time, Chinese players playing fast attack smashes). China Olympic gold medals three silvers 2000, continued dominate. Table The table 2.74 (9.0 ft) long, 1.525 (5.0 ft) wide, 76 cm (2.5 ft) high continuous material table yields uniform bounce 23 cm (9.1 in) standard ball dropped height 30 cm (11.8 in), 77%. The table playing surface uniformly dark coloured matte, divided halves 15.25 cm (6.0 in) height. The ITTF approves wooden tables derivates. Concrete tables steel solid concrete partition public spaces, parks. Paddle/racket Players equipped laminated wooden racket covered rubber depending grip player. The ITTF term "racket", "bat" common Britain, "paddle" U.S. Canada.The wooden portion racket, referred "blade", commonly features plies wood, cork, glass fiber, carbon fiber, aluminum fiber, Kevlar used. According ITTF regulations, 85% blade thickness natural wood. Common wood types include balsa, limba, cypress "hinoki", popular Japan. The average size blade 17 centimetres (6.7 in) 15 centimetres (5.9 in) wide. Although official restrictions focus flatness rigidness blade itself, dimensions optimal play styles.Table tennis regulations allow surfaces racket. Various types surfaces levels spin speed, cases nullify spin. For example, player rubber spin racket, spin other. By flipping racket play, types returns possible. To help player distinguish rubber opposing player, international rules black. The player inspect opponent's racket match type rubber colour is. Despite high speed play rapid exchanges, player clearly racket ball. Current rules that, damaged play, racket exchanged racket match. Gameplay Starting game According ITTF rule 2.13.1, service decided lot, coin toss. It common player (or umpire/scorer) hide ball hand, hidden table, allowing player guess ball in. The correct incorrect guess "winner" option choose serve, receive, choose table use. (A common non-sanctioned method players play ball three play point. This commonly referred "serve play", "rally serve", "play serve", "volley serve".) Service return In game play, player serving ball commences play. The server stands ball held open palm carrying paddle, called freehand, tosses ball directly upward spin, 16 cm (6.3 in) high. The server strikes ball racket ball's descent touches court touches directly receiver's court touching assembly. In casual games, players toss ball upward; however, technically illegal serving player unfair advantage.The ball remain endline upper surface table, playing surface, service. The server his/her clothing obstruct sight ball; opponent umpire clear view ball times. If umpire doubtful legality service interrupt play warning server. If serve clear failure doubted umpire warning, receiver scores point.If service "good", receiver "good" return hitting ball bounces second receiver's table ball passes touches opponent's court, directly touching assembly. Thereafter, server receiver alternately return rally over. Returning serve difficult parts game, server's move predictable advantageous shot numerous spin speed choices disposal. Let A Let rally scored, called circumstances:The ball touches service (service), provided service correct ball obstructed player receiving side. Obstruction player touches ball traveling playing surface, touched player's court struck player.When player receiving service delivered.Player's failure service return comply Laws disturbance control player.Play interrupted umpire assistant umpire.A called foul service, ball hits server's table, ball pass edge ball hits table edge hits net. Scoring A point scored player rally:The opponent fails correct service return.After making service return, ball touches assembly struck opponent.The ball passes player's court touching court, struck opponent.The opponent obstructs ball.The opponent strikes ball successively. Note holding racket counts racket making good return one's fingers allowed. It fault ball accidentally hits one's fingers subsequently hits racket.The opponent strikes ball racket blade surface covered rubber.The opponent moves playing surface touches assembly.The opponent's free touches playing surface.As receiver expedite system, completing 13 returns rally.The opponent warned umpire commits second offense individual match team match. If third offence happens, 2 points player. If individual match team match ended, unused penalty points transferred game match.A game player scoring 11 points players score 10 points, game player subsequently gaining lead 2 points. A match consist best odd number games. In competition play, matches typically best games. Alternation services Service alternates opponents points (regardless winner rally) game, players score points expedite system operated, sequences serving receiving stay player serves point turn (Deuce). The player serving game receives game match.After game, players switch table. In game match, example seventh game best matches, players change player scores points, turn serve. Service subject change game point match. Upon point match, player lesser score serves. If sequence serving receiving turn changed, points scored wrong situation calculated game resumed order score reached. Doubles game In addition games individual players, pairs play table tennis. Singles doubles played international competition, including Olympic Games 1988 Commonwealth Games 2002. In 2005, ITTF announced doubles table tennis featured team events 2008 Olympics.In doubles, rules single play applied following.ServiceA painted axis table create doubles courts bisects table. This line's purpose facilitate doubles service rule, service originate "box" bounce serve bounces box bounce opponent side's box (far left box server), receiving pair score point.Order play, serving receivingPlayers ball turn. For example, A paired B, X paired Y, A server X receiver. The order play A→X→B→Y. The rally proceeds fails legal return scores.At change service, receiver server partner server receiver. For example, order play A→X→B→Y, order X→B→Y→A change service.In second games match, game reverse order play. For example, order play A→X→B→Y game, order X→A→Y→B Y→B→X→A second game depending X Y chosen server game. That receiver game player served server game preceding game. In game doubles match, pair serve choose so. The receiving pair, however, choose game match.When pair reaches 5 points final game, pairs switch table change receiver reverse order play. For example, order play pair score 5 points final game A→X→B→Y, order change A→Y→B→X A second serve. Otherwise, X server order X→A→Y→B. Expedite system If game unfinished 10 minutes' play fewer 18 points scored, expedite system initiated. The umpire interrupts game, game resumes players serving point turn. If expedite system introduced ball play, receiver serve first. Under expedite system, server point opponent 13 consecutive returns point opponent. The system initiated request players pairs. Once introduced, expedite system remains force match. A rule shorten match, defensive players' games. Grips Though table tennis players grip rackets ways, grips classified major families styles, penhold shakehand. The rules table tennis prescribe manner grip racket, numerous grips employed. Penhold The penhold grip so-named grips racket holds writing instrument. The style play penhold players vary greatly player player. The popular style, referred Chinese penhold style, involves curling middle, ring, fourth finger blade three fingers touching another. Chinese penholders favour racket head, over-the-table style play. In contrast, style, referred Japanese/Korean penhold grip, involves splaying three fingers racket, three fingers touching racket, stacked another. Sometimes combination styles occurs, middle, fourth fingers straight, stacked, fingers touching racket, contact another. Japanese/Korean penholders square-headed racket away-from-the-table style play. Traditionally square-headed rackets feature block cork handle, well layer cork racket, increased grip comfort. Penhold styles popular players originating East Asian regions China, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea.Traditionally, penhold players racket ball play, contact three fingers generally used. This configuration referred "traditional penhold" commonly square-headed racket styles. However, Chinese developed technique 1990s penholder racket ball, player produces backhand stroke (most topspin) reverse penhold backhand turning traditional racket face one's self, striking ball opposite racket. This stroke greatly improved strengthened penhold style physically psychologically, eliminates strategic weakness traditional penhold backhand. Shakehand The shakehand grip so-named racket grasped performing handshake. Though referred "tennis" "Western" grip, bears relation Western tennis grip, popularized West Coast United States racket rotated 90°, played wrist turned impact knuckles face target. In table tennis, "Western" refers Western nations, grip players native Europe Americas exclusively employed.The shakehand grip’s simplicity versatility, coupled acceptance top-level Chinese trainers European style play emulated trained against, established common grip China. Many class European Asian players currently shakehand grip, generally accepted shakehands easier learn penholder, allowing broader range playing styles offensive defensive. Seemiller The Seemiller grip named American table tennis champion Danny Seemiller, it. It achieved placing thumb finger bottom racquet head holding handle rest fingers. Since racquet ball, contrasting rubber types applied blade, offering advantage "twiddling" racket fool opponent. Seemiller paired inverted rubber anti-spin rubber; players today combine inverted long-pipped rubber. The grip considered exceptional blocking, backhand side, loops backspin balls. The Seemiller grip's popularity reached apex 1985 (Danny Seemiller, Ricky Seemiller, Eric Boggan Brian Masters) United States' participants World Championships it. Types strokes Table tennis strokes generally break offensive defensive categories. Offensive strokes Hit A direct ball propelling forward opponent. This stroke differs speed drives racket sports tennis racket perpendicular direction stroke energy applied ball speed spin, creating shot much, fast difficult return. A speed drive keeping ball play, applying pressure opponent, opening opportunity powerful attack. Loop Perfected 1960s, loop essentially reverse speed drive. The racket parallel direction stroke ("closed") racket grazes ball, amount topspin. A good loop drive bit, striking opponent's table jump forward, kick serve tennis. Counter-hit The counter-hit counterattack drives, high loop drives. The racket held closed ball, short movement "off bounce" (immediately hitting table) ball travels faster side. A well-timed, accurate counter-drive effective smash. Flip When player attack ball bounced edge table, player room wind backswing. The ball attacked, however, shot called flip backswing compressed wrist action. A flip single stroke resemble loop drive loop characteristics. What identifies stroke backswing compressed short wrist flick. Smash The offensive trump card smash. A player typically execute smash opponent returned ball bounces high close net. Smashing consists backswing rapid acceleration impart speed ball possible. The goal smash ball move opponent simply return it. Because ball speed aim shot, spin ball topspin. Sidespin effectively smash alter ball's trajectory significantly, intermediate players smash ball spin. An offensive table tennis player rally build-up winning smash. Defensive strokes Push The push (or "slice" Asia) keeping point alive creating offensive opportunities. A push resembles tennis slice: racket cuts underneath ball, imparting backspin causing ball float slowly table. While obvious, push difficult attack backspin ball drop table striking opponent's racket. In order attack push, player loop ball net. Often, best option beginners simply push ball again, pushing rallies. Against good players, worst option opponent counter loop, putting player defensive position. Another response pushing flipping ball close net. Pushing advantages circumstances, opponent easy mistakes. Chop A chop defensive, backspin counterpart offensive loop drive. A chop essentially bigger, heavier push, well table. The racket face points horizontally, bit upward, direction stroke straight down. The object defensive chop match topspin opponent's shot backspin. A good chop float horizontally table, cases backspin ball rises. Such chop extremely difficult return enormous amount backspin. Some defensive players impart no-spin sidespin variations chop. Block The block simple shot, devastating attacking opponent. A block executed simply placing racket front ball ball bounces; thus, ball rebounds opponent energy with. This easy sounds, ball's spin, speed, location influence correct angle block. It opponent execute perfect loop, drive, smash, blocked shot fast. Due power involved offensive strokes, opponent simply recover enough, unable return blocked shot. Blocks produce spin received, topspin. Depending spin ball, block returned unexpected table. This advantage, opponent expect this. Lob The defensive lob impressive shot, propels ball metres height, land opponent's table great amounts spin. To execute, defensive player backs-off table 4–6 meters; then, stroke consists lifting ball enormous height falls opponent's table. A lob inherently creative shot, kind spin. Top-quality players advantage order control spin ball. For instance, opponent smash ball fast, good defensive lob difficult return unpredictability heavy amounts spin ball. Thus, backed table tens feet running reach ball, good defensive player point good lobs. However, professional level, lobbers lose point time, lob necessary. Effects spin Adding spin ball major changes table tennis gameplay. Although stroke serve creates kind spin, understanding individual types spin allows players defend spins effectively. Backspin Backspin bottom half ball rotating player, imparted striking base ball movement. At professional level, backspin defensively order ball low. Backspin commonly employed service harder produce offensive return, professional level people serve sidespin backspin topspin. Due initial lift ball, limit speed ball missing opponent's table. However, backspin harder opponent return ball great speed required angular precision return. Alterations frequently regulations equipment effort maintain balance defensive offensive spin choices. It smash backspin offensively, high balls close net. Topspin The topspin stroke smaller influence ball-curve. Like backspin stroke, however, axis spin remains roughly perpendicular trajectory ball allowing Magnus dictate subsequent curvature. After apex curve, ball dips approaches opposing side, bouncing. On bounce, topspin accelerate ball, wheel spinning accelerate making contact ground. When opponent attempts return ball, topspin ball jump upwards opponent forced compensate topspin adjusting angle racket. This "closing racket". The speed limitation topspin stroke minor compared backspin stroke. This stroke technique professional competition opponent respond. In table tennis topspin regarded offensive technique increased ball speed, lower bio-mechanical efficiency pressure puts opponent reducing reaction time. (It play defensive topspin-lobs table, highly skilled players stroke tactical efficiency.) Topspin common type spin service professional level, simply easier attack top-spin ball moving high speed. Sidespin This type spin employed service, contact angle racket easily varied. Unlike aforementioned techniques, sidespin ball spin axis vertical, horizontal. The axis rotation roughly perpendicular trajectory ball. In circumstance, Magnus dictate curvature ball degree. Another difference backspin topspin, sidespin bounce ball, spinning travel left axis rotation exactly vertical. This sidespin weapon service, easily recognized bouncing, ball "loses" spin bounce. Sidespin employed offensive rally strokes, greater distance, adjunct topspin backspin. This stroke referred "hook". The hook extreme cases circumvent table. Corkspin This type spin exclusively employed service, lob professional level. Unlike aforementioned techniques, corkspin (sometimes referred "drill-spin") features unique situation axis spin parallel trajectory ball. This Magnus trajectory cork-spun ball. Upon bouncing, ball dart left, depending direction spin, making difficult return. Although theory type spin produces obnoxious effects, strategically practical sidespin backspin terms limitations imposes opponent return. Aside initial direction change bouncing, provided exceed reach opponent, cork-spun ball easily countered topspin backspin. Similar backspin stroke, corkspin stroke lower maximum velocity, simply contact angle racket producing stroke. To impart spin ball parallel trajectory, racket swung perpendicular trajectory ball. This greatly limits amount forward momentum transferred ball racket. Corkspin mixed variety spin, effective harder produce own.

Computer software, simply software, computer system consists data computer instructions, contrast physical hardware system built. In computer science software engineering, computer software processed computer systems, programs data. Computer software includes computer programs, libraries non-executable data, online documentation digital media. Computer hardware software require realistically own.At lowest level, executable code consists machine language instructions individual processor—typically central processing unit (CPU). A machine language consists groups binary values signifying processor instructions change computer preceding state. For example, instruction change stored storage location computer—an directly observable user. An instruction (indirectly) appear display computer system—a change visible user. The processor carries instructions order provided, instructed "jump" instruction, interrupted (by multi-core processors dominant, core instructions order; then, however, application software runs core default, software many).The majority software written high-level programming languages easier efficient programmers, meaning closer natural language. High-level languages translated machine language compiler interpreter combination two. Software written low-level assembly language, essentially, vaguely mnemonic representation machine language natural language alphabet, translated machine language assembler. History An outline (algorithm) piece software written Ada Lovelace 19th century, planned Analytical Engine. However, Analytical Engine software created.The theory software—prior creation computers today—was proposed Alan Turing 1935 essay Computable numbers application Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem).This eventually led creation twin academic fields computer science software engineering, study software creation. Computer science theoretical (Turing's essay example computer science), software engineering focuses practical concerns.However, prior 1946, software understand it—programs stored memory stored-program digital computers—did exist. The electronic computing devices rewired order "reprogram" them. Types software On virtually computer platforms, software grouped broad categories. Purpose, domain Based goal, computer software divided into:Application software, software computer system perform functions entertainment functions basic operation computer itself. There types application software, range tasks performed modern computer large—see list software.System software, software directly operates computer hardware, basic functionality needed users software, platform running application software. System software includes:Operating systems, essential collections software manage resources common services software runs "on top" them. Supervisory programs, boot loaders, shells window systems core parts operating systems. In practice, operating system bundled additional software (including application software) user work computer operating system.Device drivers, operate control type device attached computer. Each device corresponding device driver; computer typically minimum input device output device, computer typically device driver.Utilities, computer programs designed assist users maintenance care computers.Malicious software malware, software developed harm disrupt computers. As such, malware undesirable. Malware closely associated computer-related crimes, malicious programs designed practical jokes. Nature domain execution Desktop applications web browsers Microsoft Office, well smartphone tablet applications (called "apps"). (There push parts software industry merge desktop applications mobile apps, extent. Windows 8, Ubuntu Touch, allow style application user interface desktops, laptops mobiles.)JavaScript scripts pieces software traditionally embedded web directly inside web browser web loaded web browser plugin. Software written programming languages web browser software translated JavaScript, web browser plugin supports language installed; common example ActionScript scripts, supported Adobe Flash plugin.Server software, including:Web applications, web server output dynamically generated web web browsers, e.g. PHP, Java, ASP.NET, JavaScript runs server. In modern commonly include JavaScript web browser well, case typically partly server, partly web browser.Plugins extensions software extends modifies functionality piece software, require software order function;Embedded software resides firmware embedded systems, devices dedicated single cars televisions (although embedded devices wireless chipsets ordinary, non-embedded computer system PC smartphone). In embedded system context clear distinction system software application software. However, embedded systems embedded operating systems, systems retain distinction system software application software (although typically one, fixed, application run).Microcode special, obscure type embedded software tells processor execute machine code, lower level machine code. It typically proprietary processor manufacturer, correctional microcode software updates supplied users (which cheaper shipping replacement processor hardware). Thus ordinary programmer expect deal it. Programming tools Programming tools software programs applications software developers (also programmers, coders, hackers software engineers) create, debug, maintain (i.e. improve fix), support software. Software written programming languages; programming languages existence, implementation, consists set programming tools. These tools self-contained programs compilers, debuggers, interpreters, linkers, text editors, combined accomplish task; integrated development environment (IDE), combines functionality self-contained tools. IDEs invoking relevant individual tools re-implementing functionality way. An IDE easier tasks, searching files project. Many programming language implementations option individual tools IDE. Software topics Architecture Users things differently programmers. People modern general purpose computers (as opposed embedded systems, analog computers supercomputers) three layers software performing variety tasks: platform, application, user software.Platform software: The Platform includes firmware, device drivers, operating system, typically graphical user interface which, total, allow user interact computer peripherals (associated equipment). Platform software bundled computer. On PC ability change platform software.Application software: Application software Applications people software. Typical examples include office suites video games. Application software purchased separately computer hardware. Sometimes applications bundled computer, change fact independent applications. Applications independent programs operating system, tailored platforms. Most users compilers, databases, "system software" applications.User-written software: End-user development tailors systems meet users' needs. User software include spreadsheet templates processor templates. Even email filters kind user software. Users create software overlook is. Depending competently user-written software integrated default application packages, users aware distinction original packages, co-workers. Execution Computer software "loaded" computer's storage (such drive memory). Once software loaded, computer execute software. This involves passing instructions application software, system software, hardware ultimately receives instruction machine code. Each instruction computer carry operation—moving data, carrying computation, altering control flow instructions.Data movement typically memory another. Sometimes involves moving data memory registers enable high-speed data access CPU. Moving data, amounts it, costly. So, avoided "pointers" data instead. Computations include simple operations incrementing variable data element. More complex computations involve operations data elements together. Quality reliability Software quality important, commercial system software Microsoft Office, Microsoft Windows Linux. If software faulty (buggy), delete person's work, crash computer unexpected things. Faults errors called "bugs" discovered alpha beta testing. Software victim software aging, progressive performance degradation combination unseen bugs.Many bugs discovered eliminated (debugged) software testing. However, software testing rarely—if ever—eliminates bug; programmers "every program bug" (Lubarsky's Law). In waterfall method software development, separate testing teams typically employed, newer approaches, collectively termed agile software development, developers testing, demonstrate software users/clients regularly feedback. Software tested unit testing, regression testing methods, manually, commonly, automatically, amount code tested large. For instance, NASA extremely rigorous software testing procedures operating systems communication functions. Many NASA-based operations interact identify command programs. This enables people work NASA check evaluate functional systems overall. Programs command software enable hardware engineering system operations function easier together. License The software's license user software licensed environment, case free software licenses, grants rights copies.Proprietary software divided types:freeware, includes category "free trial" software "freemium" software (in past, term shareware free trial/freemium software). As suggests, freeware free, case free trials freemium software, true limited period limited functionality.software fee, inaccurately termed "commercial software", legally purchase license.Open source software, hand, free software license, granting recipient rights modify redistribute software. Patents Software patents, types patents, theoretically supposed inventor exclusive, time-limited license detailed idea (e.g. algorithm) implement piece software, component piece software. Ideas things software do, user requirements, supposed patentable, concrete implementations (i.e. software packages implementing patent) supposed patentable either—the covered copyright, generally automatically. So software patents supposed cover middle area, requirements concrete implementation. In countries, requirement claimed physical requirements software patent held valid—although software effects physical world, requirement open debate.Software patents controversial software industry people holding views them. One sources controversy aforementioned split initial ideas patent honored practice patent lawyers—for example patent Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), purported claim rights programming tool implementing idea AOP, howsoever implemented. Another source controversy innovation, distinguished experts companies arguing software fast-moving field software patents create vast additional litigation costs risks, retard innovation. In case debates software patents United States, argument American corporations patent lawyers primary beneficiaries allowing continue allow software patents. Design implementation Design implementation software varies depending complexity software. For instance, design creation Microsoft Word designing developing Microsoft Notepad basic functionality.Software designed created (aka coded/written/programmed) integrated development environments (IDE) Eclipse, IntelliJ Microsoft Visual Studio simplify process compile software (if applicable). As section, software created existing software application programming interface (API) underlying software GTK+, JavaBeans Swing. Libraries (APIs) categorized purpose. For instance, Spring Framework implementing enterprise applications, Windows Forms library designing graphical user interface (GUI) applications Microsoft Word, Windows Communication Foundation designing web services. When program designed, relies API. For instance, user designing Microsoft Windows desktop application, .NET Windows Forms library design desktop application APIs Form1.Close() Form1.Show() close open application, write additional operations him/herself have. Without APIs, programmer write APIs him/herself. Companies Oracle Microsoft APIs applications written software libraries numerous APIs them.Data structures hash tables, arrays, binary trees, algorithms quicksort, creating software.Computer software economic characteristics design, creation, distribution economic goods.A person creates software called programmer, software engineer software developer, terms meaning. More informal terms programmer exist "coder" "hacker" – confusion, illegally breaks computer systems. Industry organizations A great variety software companies programmers comprise software industry. Software profitable industry: Bill Gates, co-founder Microsoft richest person 2009, ownership number shares Microsoft, company responsible Microsoft Windows Microsoft Office software products.Non-profit software organizations include Free Software Foundation, GNU Project Mozilla Foundation. Software standard organizations W3C, IETF develop recommended software standards XML, HTTP HTML, software interoperate standards.Other well-known software companies include Oracle, Novell, SAP, Symantec, Adobe Systems, Corel, small companies innovation.

A sale exchange commodity money price good service. Sales (plural only) activity selling amount goods services sold period.The seller provider goods services completes sale response acquisition, appropriation, requisition direct interaction buyer point sale. There passing title (property ownership) item, settlement price, agreement reached price transfer ownership item occur. The seller, purchaser generally executes sale completed prior obligation payment. In case indirect interaction, person sells goods service behalf owner salesman saleswoman salesperson, refers selling goods store/shop, case terms common, including salesclerk, shop assistant, retail clerk.In common law countries, sales governed generally common law commercial codes. In United States, laws governing sales goods uniform extent jurisdictions Article 2 Uniform Commercial Code, albeit non-uniform variations. Definition A person organization expressing interest acquiring offered item referred buyer, prospective customer prospect. Buying selling understood "coin" transaction. Both seller buyer engage process negotiation consummate exchange values. The exchange, selling, process implied rules identifiable stages. It implied selling process proceed fairly ethically parties equally rewarded. The stages selling, buying, involve acquainted, assessing party's other's item value, determining values exchanged equivalent so, or, buyer's terms, "worth price". Sometimes, sellers experiences selling products appropriate discounts.From management viewpoint thought marketing, skills required different. Sales forms separate grouping corporate structure, employing separate specialist operatives salespersons (singular: salesperson). Selling considered sort persuading "art". Contrary popular belief, methodological approach selling refers systematic process repetitive measurable milestones, salesman relates offering product service return enabling buyer achieve goal economic way. While sales process refers systematic process repetitive measurable milestones, definition selling ambiguous close nature advertising, promotion, public relations, direct marketing.Selling profession-wide term, marketing defines profession. Recently, attempts clearly understand sales profession, not. There articles marketing, advertising, promotions, public relations create unique transaction.Two common terms describe salesperson "Farmer" "Hunter". The reality professional sales people both. A hunter associated aggressive personalities aggressive sales technique. In terms sales methodology hunter refers person focus bringing closing deals. This process called "sales capturing". An example commodity sale distance sales person, shoe sales person degree car sales person. Their job find convert buyers. A sales farmer creates sales demand activities directly influence alter buying process.Many focus selling human agents involved exchange buyer seller. Effective selling requires systems approach, minimum involving roles sell, enable selling, develop sales capabilities. Selling involves salespeople possess set sales skills knowledge required facilitate exchange buyers sellers unique marketing, advertising, etc.Within three tenets, definition professional selling offered American Society Training Development (ASTD):Team selling influence sales. Team selling "a group people representing sales department functional areas firm, finance, production, development". (Spiro) Team selling 1990s total quality management (TQM). TQM occurs companies work improve customer satisfaction constantly improving operations. Relationships marketing Marketing sales greatly, generally goal. Selling final stage marketing, includes pricing, promotion, product (the 4 P's). A marketing department organization goals increasing desirability customer increasing number engagement interactions customers organization. Achieving goal involve sales team promotional techniques advertising, sales promotion, publicity, public relations, creating sales channels, creating products (new product development), things. It include bringing customer visit organization's website(s) information, contact organization information, interact organization social Twitter, Facebook blogs. Social values play major role consumer decision processes.The field sales process engineering views "sales" output larger system, output department. The larger system includes functional areas organization. From perspective, "sales" "marketing" (among others, "customer service") label number processes inputs outputs supply varying degrees. In context, improving "output" (such sales) involves studying improving broader sales process, system, component functional areas interact interdependent.Many corporations structure marketing departments directly integrated lines business. They create multiple teams singular focus managers teams coordinate efforts order drive profits business success. For example, "inbound" focused campaign seeks drive customers "through door", sales department better chance selling product consumer. A good marketing program address downsides well.The sales department aim improve interaction customer sales facility mechanism (example, web site) and/or salesperson. Sales management break selling process increase effectiveness discrete processes well interaction processes. For example, out-bound sales environments, typical process includes out-bound calling, sales pitch, handling objections, opportunity identification, close. Each step process sales-related issues, skills, training needs, well marketing solutions improve discrete step, well process.One common complication marketing involves inability measure great deal marketing initiatives. In essence, marketing advertising executives lose sight objective sales/revenue/profit, focus establishing creative/innovative program, concern bottom lines – fundamental pitfall marketing marketing's sake.Many companies find challenging marketing sales page. The departments, nature, handle concepts work sales successful. Building good relationship encourages communication – economy. Industrial marketing The idea marketing eliminate sales people depends entirely context. For example, B2C situations; however, B2B transactions (for example, involving industrial organizations) impossible. Another dimension goods sold. Fast-moving consumer-goods (FMCG) require sales people point sale jump supermarket shelf customer's trolley. However, purchase mining equipment worth millions dollars require sales person manage sales process – face competitors. Small medium businesses selling ticket items geographically-disperse client base manufacturers' representatives highly personal service avoiding expense captive sales force. Sales marketing alignment integration Another area discussion involves alignment integration corporate sales marketing functions. According report Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Council, 40 percent companies formal programs, systems processes align integrate critical functions.Traditionally, functions, referenced above, operated separately, left siloed areas tactical responsibility. Glen Petersen's book The Profit Maximization Paradox sees changes competitive landscape 1950s writing dramatic complexity choice, price opportunities customer forced seemingly simple integrated relationship sales marketing change forever. Petersen highlight salespeople spend 40 percent preparing customer-facing deliverables leveraging 50 percent materials created marketing, adding perceptions marketing touch customer sales resistant messaging strategy. Methods List methods A sale through:Direct sales, involving person person contactChannel sales, indirect sales model, differs direct sales. Channel selling ("B2B") sellers reach ("B2B") ("B2C") markets distributors, re-sellers re-sellers VARS.Pro salesAgency-basedSales agents (for example estate manufacturing)Sales outsourcing direct branded representationTransaction salesConsultative salesComplex salesConsignmentTelemarketing telesalesRetail consumerTraveling salesmanDoor-to-door methodshawkingRequest proposal – An invitation suppliers, bidding process, submit proposal product service.

The role salesman oversee parties receive honest fair deal, responsible both.Transaction broker: This salesperson represents party handles transaction only. The seller owes responsibility party fair honest deal, papers handled properly.Sales outsourcing involves direct branded representation sales representatives recruited, hired, managed external entity hold quotas, represent brand client, report activities (through sales management channels) client. It virtual extension sales force (see sales outsourcing).Sales managers aim implement sales strategies management techniques order facilitate improved profits increased sales volume. They responsible coordinating sales marketing department well oversight concerning fair honest execution sales process agents.Salesperson: The primary function professional salespeople generate close business revenue. The sales person accomplish primary function variety including phone calls, email, social media, networking, cold calling. The primary objective salesperson find consumers sell to. Sales referred "numbers game" general law averages pattern closing business emerge heightened sales activity. These activities include limited to: locating prospects, fostering relationships prospects, building trust future clients, identifying filling consumers, turning prospective customers ones. Many tools salespeople, questioning defined series questions answers allowing salesperson understand customer's goals requirements relevant product. The creation perceived gathered, analyzing goals prospective customer leveraging products and/or services salesperson's firm represents sells effectively achieves prospective clients goals and/or suits needs. Effective salespeople package offering proposed solution leads prospective customer conclusion acquire solution, revenue profit salesperson organization represent.Internet Sales Professionals: These people responsible ensuring response leads generated social media, website email campaigns. Inside sales vs. Outside sales Since advent telephone, distinction "inside sales" "outside sales" generally agreed terms hard-and-fast definition. In United States, Fair Labor Standards Act defines sales representatives "employees [who] sell employer's products, services, facilities customers employer's place(s) business, general, customer's business selling door-to-door customer's home" defining work "from employer's location" inside sales. Inside sales generally involves attempting close business phone telemarketing, sales (or "field" sales) involve initial phone work book sales calls buyer's location attempt close deal person. Some companies inside sales department works representatives book appointments them. Inside sales refers upselling existing customers.

It succeeded Windows 10 Mobile. Version history The term Windows collectively describes generations Microsoft operating system products. These products generally categorized follows: Early versions The history Windows dates September 1981, Chase Bishop, computer scientist, designed model electronic device project Interface Manager started. It announced November 1983 (after Apple Lisa, Macintosh) "Windows", Windows 1.0 released November 1985. Windows 1.0 compete Apple's operating system, achieved popularity. Windows 1.0 complete operating system; rather, extends MS-DOS. The shell Windows 1.0 program MS-DOS Executive. Components included Calculator, Calendar, Cardfile, Clipboard viewer, Clock, Control Panel, Notepad, Paint, Reversi, Terminal Write. Windows 1.0 allow overlapping windows. Instead windows tiled. Only modal dialog boxes appear windows.Windows 2.0 released December 1987, popular predecessor. It features improvements user interface memory management. Windows 2.03 changed OS tiled windows overlapping windows. The change led Apple Computer filing suit Microsoft alleging infringement Apple's copyrights. Windows 2.0 introduced sophisticated keyboard shortcuts expanded memory.Windows 2.1 released versions: Windows/286 Windows/386. Windows/386 virtual 8086 mode Intel 80386 multitask DOS programs paged memory model emulate expanded memory extended memory. Windows/286, spite name, runs Intel 8086 Intel 80286 processors. It runs mode high memory area.In addition Windows-packages, runtime-only versions shipped Windows software third parties Windows software MS-DOS Windows feature set.The versions Windows thought graphical shells, MS-DOS file system services. However, earliest Windows versions assumed typical operating system functions; notably, executable file providing device drivers (timer, graphics, printer, mouse, keyboard sound). Unlike MS-DOS, Windows allowed users execute multiple graphical applications time, cooperative multitasking. Windows implemented elaborate, segment-based, software virtual memory scheme, allows applications larger memory: code segments resources swapped thrown memory scarce; data segments moved memory application relinquished processor control. Windows 3.x Windows 3.0, released 1990, improved design, virtual memory loadable virtual device drivers (VxDs) allow Windows share arbitrary devices multi-tasked DOS applications. Windows 3.0 applications protected mode, access megabytes memory obligation participate software virtual memory scheme. They inside address space, segmented memory degree protection. Windows 3.0 featured improvements user interface. Microsoft rewrote critical operations C assembly. Windows 3.0 Microsoft Windows version achieve broad commercial success, selling 2 copies months.Windows 3.1, generally March 1, 1992, featured facelift. In August 1993, Windows Workgroups, version integrated peer-to-peer networking features version number 3.11, released. It sold Windows 3.1. Support Windows 3.1 ended December 31, 2001.Windows 3.2, released 1994, updated version Chinese version Windows 3.1. The update limited language version, fixed issues complex writing system Chinese language. Windows 3.2 generally sold computer manufacturers ten-disk version MS-DOS Simplified Chinese characters basic output translated utilities. Windows 9x The major consumer-oriented release Windows, Windows 95, released August 24, 1995. While remaining MS-DOS-based, Windows 95 introduced support native 32-bit applications, plug play hardware, preemptive multitasking, file names 255 characters, provided increased stability predecessors. Windows 95 introduced redesigned, object oriented user interface, replacing Program Manager Start menu, taskbar, Windows Explorer shell. Windows 95 major commercial Microsoft; Ina Fried CNET remarked "by Windows 95 finally ushered market 2001, fixture computer desktops world." Microsoft published OEM Service Releases (OSR) Windows 95, roughly equivalent service pack. The OSR Windows 95 version Windows bundled Microsoft's web browser, Internet Explorer. Mainstream support Windows 95 ended December 31, 2000, extended support Windows 95 ended December 31, 2001.Windows 95 release Windows 98 June 25, 1998, introduced Windows Driver Model, support USB composite devices, support ACPI, hibernation, support multi-monitor configurations.

Timeline releases Usage share device sales According Net Applications, tracks based web use, Windows most-used operating system family personal computers June 2016 close 90% usage share. When including personal computers kinds, e.g. mobile devices, July 2016, StatCounter, tracks based web use, Windows OSes accounted 46.87% usage share, compared 36.48% Android, 12.26% iOS, 4.81% macOS. The 50% usage share Windows, applies developed countries, US, UK Ireland. These numbers easiest (monthly numbers) find track use, mirror installed base sales numbers (in years) devices.In terms number devices shipped operating system installed, smartphones, Windows Phone third-most-shipped OS (2.6%) Android (82.8%) iOS (13.9%) second quarter 2015 IDC. Across PCs mobile devices, 2014, Windows OSes second-most-shipped (333 devices, 14%) Android (1.2 billion, 49%) ahead iOS macOS combined (263 million, 11%). Security Consumer versions Windows originally designed ease-of-use single-user PC network connection, security features built outset. However, Windows NT successors designed security (including network) multi-user PCs, initially designed Internet security mind much, since, developed 1990s, Internet prevalent.These design issues combined programming errors (e.g. buffer overflows) popularity Windows frequent target computer worm virus writers. In June 2005, Bruce Schneier's Counterpane Internet Security reported 1,000 viruses worms months. In 2005, Kaspersky Lab 11,000 malicious programs—viruses, Trojans, back-doors, exploits written Windows.Microsoft releases security patches Windows Update service month (usually second Tuesday month), critical updates shorter intervals necessary. In versions Windows including Windows 2000 SP3 Windows XP, updates automatically downloaded installed user selects so. As result, Service Pack 2 Windows XP, well Service Pack 1 Windows Server 2003, installed users been.While Windows 9x series offered option profiles multiple users, concept access privileges, allow concurrent access; true multi-user operating systems. In addition, implemented partial memory protection. They criticised lack security.The Windows NT series operating systems, contrast, true multi-user, implement absolute memory protection. However, lot advantages true multi-user operating system nullified fact that, prior Windows Vista, user account created setup process administrator account, default accounts. Though Windows XP limited accounts, majority users change account type fewer rights – partially number programs unnecessarily required administrator rights – users administrator time.Windows Vista changes introducing privilege elevation system called User Account Control. When logging standard user, logon session created token basic privileges assigned. In way, logon session incapable making changes entire system. When logging user Administrators group, separate tokens assigned. The token privileges typically awarded administrator, second restricted token standard user receive. User applications, including Windows shell, started restricted token, reduced privilege environment Administrator account. When application requests higher privileges "Run administrator" clicked, UAC confirmation and, consent (including administrator credentials account requesting elevation member administrators group), start process unrestricted token. File permissions All Windows versions Windows NT 3 based file system permission system referred AGLP (Accounts, Global, Local, Permissions) AGDLP essence file permissions applied file/folder 'local group' 'global groups' members. These global groups hold groups users depending Windows versions used. This system varies vendor products Linux NetWare 'static' allocation permission applied directory file folder. However process AGLP/AGDLP/AGUDLP allows small number static permissions applied allows easy changes account groups reapplying file permissions files folders.

Rocket engines work action reaction push rockets forward simply expelling exhaust opposite direction high speed, work vacuum space.In fact, rockets work efficiently space atmosphere. Multistage rockets capable attaining escape velocity Earth achieve unlimited maximum altitude. Compared airbreathing engines, rockets lightweight powerful capable generating accelerations. To control flight, rockets momentum, airfoils, auxiliary reaction engines, gimballed thrust, momentum wheels, deflection exhaust stream, propellant flow, spin, and/or gravity.Rockets military recreational 13th century China. Significant scientific, interplanetary industrial occur 20th century, rocketry enabling technology Space Age, including setting foot Earth's moon. Rockets fireworks, weaponry, ejection seats, launch vehicles artificial satellites, human spaceflight, space exploration.Chemical rockets common type high power rocket, typically creating high speed exhaust combustion fuel oxidizer. The stored propellant simple pressurized gas single liquid fuel disassociates presence catalyst (monopropellants), liquids spontaneously react contact (hypergolic propellants), liquids ignited react, solid combination fuel oxidizer (solid fuel), solid fuel liquid oxidizer (hybrid propellant system). Chemical rockets store amount energy easily released form, dangerous. However, careful design, testing, construction minimizes risks. History The gunpowder-powered rockets developed Song China, 13th century. The Chinese rocket technology Mongols spread Mongol invasions Near East Europe mid 13th century. Medieval modern rockets militarily incendiary weapons sieges.An Chinese text mention rockets Huolongjing, written Chinese artillery officer Jiao Yu mid-14th century. Between 1270 1280, Hasan al-Rammah wrote al-furusiyyah al-manasib al-harbiyya (The Book Military Horsemanship Ingenious War Devices), included 107 gunpowder recipes, 22 rockets. In Europe, Konrad Kyeser described rockets military treatise Bellifortis 1405.The Rocket Italian rocchetta, meaning "bobbin" "little spindle", similarity shape bobbin spool hold thread fed spinning wheel.

The rockets witnessed William Congreve, built compressed-powder rocket encased metal, increasing effective range 100 2,000 yards, Napoleanic Wars. The mathematical treatment dynamics rocket propulsion William Moore (1813). In 1815, Alexander Dmitrievich Zasyadko constructed rocket-launching platforms, allowed rockets fired salvos (6 rockets time), gun-laying devices.William Hale 1844 greatly increased accuracy rocket artillery. The Congreve rocket improved Edward Mounier Boxer 1865.Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (1903) speculated possibility manned spaceflight rocket technology. Robert Goddard 1920 published proposed improvements rocket technology A Method Reaching Extreme Altitudes. In 1923, Hermann Oberth (1894–1989) published Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen ("The Rocket Planetary Space")Modern rockets originated Goddard attached supersonic (de Laval) nozzle combustion chamber liquid-propellant rocket. These nozzles turn hot gas combustion chamber cooler, hypersonic, highly directed jet gas, doubling thrust raising engine efficiency 2% 64%. Use liquid propellants gunpowder greatly improved effectiveness rocket artillery World War II, opened possibility manned spaceflight 1945.In 1943, production V-2 rocket began Germany. In parallel guided missile programme, rockets aircraft, assisting horizontal take-off (RATO), vertical take-off (Bachem Ba 349 "Natter") powering (Me 163, list World War II guided missiles Germany). The Allies' rocket programs sophisticated, relying unguided missiles Soviet Katyusha rocket. The Americans captured number German rocket scientists, including Wernher von Braun, brought United States Operation Paperclip. After war, rockets study high-altitude conditions, radio telemetry temperature pressure atmosphere, detection cosmic rays, research; notably Bell X-1, manned vehicle break sound barrier. Independently, Soviet Union's space program continued leadership chief designer Sergei Korolev.During Cold War, rockets extremely militarily modern intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The 1960s decade rapid development rocket technology Soviet Union (Vostok, Soyuz, Proton) United States (e.g. X-15).

Components Rockets consist propellant, propellant (such propellant tank), nozzle. They rocket engines, directional stabilization device(s) (such fins, vernier engines engine gimbals thrust vectoring, gyroscopes) structure (typically monocoque) hold components together. Rockets intended high speed atmospheric aerodynamic fairing nose cone, holds payload.As well components, rockets number components, wings (rocketplanes), parachutes, wheels (rocket cars), even, sense, person (rocket belt). Vehicles frequently possess navigation systems guidance systems typically satellite navigation inertial navigation systems. Engines Rocket engines employ principle jet propulsion. The rocket engines powering rockets great variety types; comprehensive list rocket engine. Most current rockets chemically powered rockets (usually internal combustion engines, employ decomposing monopropellant) emit hot exhaust gas. A rocket engine gas propellants, solid propellant, liquid propellant, hybrid mixture solid liquid. Some rockets heat pressure supplied source chemical reaction propellant(s), steam rockets, solar thermal rockets, nuclear thermal rocket engines simple pressurized rockets water rocket cold gas thrusters. With combustive propellants chemical reaction initiated fuel oxidizer combustion chamber, resultant hot gases accelerate rocket engine nozzle (or nozzles) rearward-facing rocket. The acceleration gases engine exerts force ("thrust") combustion chamber nozzle, propelling vehicle (according Newton's Third Law). This force (pressure area) combustion chamber wall unbalanced nozzle opening; case direction. The shape nozzle generates force directing exhaust gas axis rocket. Propellant Rocket propellant mass stored, propellant tank casing, prior propulsive mass ejected rocket engine fluid jet produce thrust. For chemical rockets propellants fuel liquid hydrogen kerosene burned oxidizer liquid oxygen nitric acid produce volumes hot gas. The oxidiser separate mixed combustion chamber, premixed, solid rockets.Sometimes propellant burned undergoes chemical reaction, 'monopropellant' hydrazine, nitrous oxide hydrogen peroxide catalytically decomposed hot gas.Alternatively, inert propellant externally heated, steam rocket, solar thermal rocket nuclear thermal rockets.For smaller, performance rockets attitude control thrusters high performance necessary, pressurised fluid propellant simply escapes spacecraft propelling nozzle. Uses Rockets reaction devices carrying propellant substance (land, water, air) force (gravity, magnetism, light) vehicle employ propulsion, space. In circumstances, carry propellant used.However, situations: Military Some military weapons rockets propel warheads targets. A rocket payload generally referred missile weapon guidance system (not missiles rocket engines, engines jets) rocket unguided. Anti-tank anti-aircraft missiles rocket engines engage targets high speed range miles, intercontinental ballistic missiles deliver multiple nuclear warheads thousands miles, anti-ballistic missiles them. Rockets tested reconnaissance, Ping-Pong rocket, launched surveil enemy targets, however, recon rockets military. Science Sounding rockets commonly carry instruments readings 50 kilometers (31 mi) 1,500 kilometers (930 mi) surface Earth.Rocket engines propel rocket sleds rail extremely high speed. The record Mach 8.5. Spaceflight Larger rockets launched launch pad stable support seconds ignition. Due high exhaust velocity—2,500 4,500 m/s (9,000 16,200 km/h; 5,600 10,100 mph)—rockets high speeds required, orbital speed 7,800 m/s (28,000 km/h; 17,000 mph). Spacecraft delivered orbital trajectories artificial satellites, commercial purposes. Indeed, rockets remain launch spacecraft orbit beyond. They rapidly accelerate spacecraft change orbits de-orbit landing. Also, rocket soften parachute landing touchdown (see retrorocket). Rescue Rockets propel stricken ship Breeches buoy rescue board. Rockets launch emergency flares.Some crewed rockets, notably Saturn V Soyuz launch escape systems. This small, solid rocket capable pulling crewed capsule vehicle safety moments notice. These types systems operated times, testing flight, operated correctly time.This case Safety Assurance System (Soviet nomenclature) pulled L3 capsule three failed launches Soviet moon rocket, N1 vehicles 3L, 5L 7L. In three cases capsule, albeit unmanned, saved destruction. It three aforementioned N1 rockets functional Safety Assurance Systems.

While joining organizations requirement, insurance flight waivers members.Hydrogen peroxide rockets power jet packs, power cars rocket car holds (albeit unofficial) drag racing record.Corpulent Stump powerful commercial rocket launched Aerotech engine United Kingdom. Noise Rocket exhaust generates amount acoustic energy. As supersonic exhaust collides ambient air, shock waves formed. The sound intensity shock waves depends size rocket well exhaust velocity. The sound intensity large, high performance rockets kill close range.The Space Shuttle generates 180 dB noise base. To combat this, NASA developed sound suppression system flow water rates 900,000 gallons minute (57 m3/s) launch pad. The water reduces noise level 180 dB 142 dB (the design requirement 145 dB). Without sound suppression system, acoustic waves reflect launch pad rocket, vibrating sensitive payload crew. These acoustic waves severe destroy rocket.Noise generally intense rocket close ground, noise engines radiates jet, well reflecting ground. This noise reduced flame trenches roofs, water injection jet deflecting jet angle.For crewed rockets methods reduce sound intensity passengers, typically placement astronauts rocket engines helps significantly. For passengers crew, vehicle supersonic sound cuts sound waves longer vehicle. Physics Operation The combustion propellant rocket engine increase velocity gases high speeds, producing thrust. Initially, gases combustion direction, produce thrust effect. The ideal direction motion exhaust direction thrust. At combustion chamber hot, energetic gas fluid move forward, so, pushes upward rocket engine's combustion chamber. As combustion gases approach exit combustion chamber, increase speed. The convergent rocket engine nozzle high pressure fluid combustion gases, gases accelerate high speed. The higher speed gases, lower pressure gas (Bernoulli's principle conservation energy) acting combustion chamber. In properly designed engine, flow reach Mach 1 throat nozzle. At point speed flow increases. Beyond throat nozzle, bell shaped expansion engine allows gases expanding push rocket engine. Thus, bell nozzle additional thrust. Simply expressed, action equal opposite reaction, Newton's third law exiting gases produce reaction force rocket causing accelerate rocket.In closed chamber, pressures equal direction acceleration occurs. If opening provided bottom chamber pressure longer acting missing section. This opening permits exhaust escape. The remaining pressures resultant thrust opposite opening, pressures push rocket along.The shape nozzle important. Consider balloon propelled air tapering nozzle. In case combination air pressure viscous friction nozzle push balloon pulled it. Using convergent/divergent nozzle force exhaust presses expands outwards, roughly doubling total force. If propellant gas continuously chamber pressures maintained propellant remains. Note case liquid propellant engines, pumps moving propellant combustion chamber maintain pressure larger combustion chamber -typically order 100 atmospheres.As effect, pressures rocket exhaust opposite direction accelerate exhaust high speeds (according Newton's Third Law). From principle conservation momentum speed exhaust rocket determines momentum increase created amount propellant. This called rocket's impulse. Because rocket, propellant exhaust flight, external perturbations, considered closed system, total momentum constant. Therefore, faster speed exhaust direction, greater speed rocket achieve opposite direction. This true rocket body's mass typically lower final total exhaust mass. Forces rocket flight The general study forces rocket field ballistics. Spacecraft studied subfield astrodynamics.Flying rockets following:Thrust engine(s)Gravity celestial bodiesDrag moving atmosphereLift; small rocket-powered aircraftRockets travel air tall shape high ballistic coefficient minimizes drag losses.In addition, inertia centrifugal pseudo-force path rocket center celestial body; high speeds direction altitude achieved stable orbit escape velocity obtained.These forces, stabilizing tail (the empennage) will, deliberate control efforts made, naturally vehicle roughly parabolic trajectory termed gravity turn, trajectory initial launch. (This true rocket engine mounted nose.) Vehicles maintain angle attack, minimizes transverse stress launch vehicle, permitting weaker, lighter, launch vehicle. Drag Drag force opposite direction rocket's motion. This decreases acceleration vehicle produces structural loads. Deceleration force fast-moving rockets calculated drag equation.Drag minimised aerodynamic nose cone shape high ballistic coefficient (the "classic" rocket shape—long thin), keeping rocket's angle attack possible.During rocket launch, vehicle speed increases, atmosphere thins, point maximum aerodynamic drag called Max Q. This determines minimum aerodynamic strength vehicle, rocket avoid buckling forces. Net thrust A typical rocket engine handle fraction mass propellant second, propellant leaving nozzle kilometres second. This thrust-to-weight ratio rocket engine, entire vehicle high, extreme cases 100. This compares jet propulsion engines exceed 5 better engines.It thrust rocket is: F ˙ {\displaystyle F_{n}{\dot {m}}\;v_{e}} where: ˙ {\displaystyle {\dot {m}}\,} propellant flow (kg/s lb/s) {\displaystyle v_{e}\,} effective exhaust velocity (m/s ft/s)The effective exhaust velocity {\displaystyle v_{e}} speed exhaust leaves vehicle, vacuum space, effective exhaust velocity equal average exhaust speed thrust axis. However, effective exhaust velocity allows losses, notably, reduced operated atmosphere.The rate propellant flow rocket engine deliberately varied flight, control thrust airspeed vehicle. This, example, allows minimization aerodynamic losses limit increase g-forces reduction propellant load. Total impulse Impulse defined force acting object time, absence opposing forces (gravity aerodynamic drag), changes momentum (integral mass velocity) object. As such, best performance class (payload mass terminal velocity capability) indicator rocket, takeoff thrust, mass, "power". The total impulse rocket (stage) burning propellant is: I ∫ F {\displaystyle I\int Fdt} When fixed thrust, simply: I F {\displaystyle IFt\;} The total impulse multi-stage rocket sum impulses individual stages. Specific impulse As thrust equation, effective speed exhaust controls amount thrust produced quantity fuel burnt second.An equivalent measure, impulse weight unit propellant expelled, called Impulse, I {\displaystyle I_{sp}} , figures describes rocket's performance. It defined effective exhaust velocity by: I ⋅ 0 {\displaystyle v_{e}I_{sp}\cdot g_{0}} where: I {\displaystyle I_{sp}} units seconds 0 {\displaystyle g_{0}} acceleration surface EarthThus, greater impulse, greater thrust performance engine. I {\displaystyle I_{sp}} determined measurement testing engine. In practice effective exhaust velocities rockets varies extremely high, ~4500 m/s, 15 level speed sound air. Delta-v (rocket equation) The delta-v capacity rocket theoretical total change velocity rocket achieve external interference (without air drag gravity forces).When {\displaystyle v_{e}} constant, delta-v rocket vehicle calculated Tsiolkovsky rocket equation: Δ ⁡ 0 1 {\displaystyle \Delta v\ v_{e}\ln {\frac {m_{0}}{m_{1}}}} where: 0 {\displaystyle m_{0}} initial total mass, including propellant, (or lb) 1 {\displaystyle m_{1}} final total mass (or lb) {\displaystyle v_{e}} effective exhaust velocity m/s (or ft/s) Δ {\displaystyle \Delta v\ } delta-v m/s (or ft/s)When launched Earth practical delta-vs single rockets carrying payloads km/s. Some theoretical designs rockets delta-vs 9 km/s.The required delta-v calculated manoeuvre; example delta-v launch surface Earth Low earth orbit 9.7 km/s, leaves vehicle sideways speed 7.8 km/s altitude 200 km. In manoeuvre 1.9 km/s lost air drag, gravity drag gaining altitude.The ratio 0 1 {\displaystyle {\frac {m_{0}}{m_{1}}}} called mass ratio. Mass ratios Almost launch vehicle's mass consists propellant. Mass ratio is, 'burn', ratio rocket's initial mass final mass. Everything equal, high mass ratio desirable good performance, indicates rocket lightweight performs better, essentially reasons weight desirable sports cars.Rockets group highest thrust-to-weight ratio type engine; helps vehicles achieve high mass ratios, improves performance flights. The higher ratio, engine mass needed carried. This permits carrying propellant, enormously improving delta-v. Alternatively, rockets rescue scenarios racing carry propellant payload lightweight structure achieve high accelerations. For example, Soyuz escape system produce 20g.Achievable mass ratios highly dependent factors propellant type, design engine vehicle uses, structural safety margins construction techniques.The highest mass ratios generally achieved liquid rockets, types orbital launch vehicles, situation calls high delta-v. Liquid propellants generally densities water (with notable exceptions liquid hydrogen liquid methane), types lightweight, pressure tanks typically high-performance turbopumps force propellant combustion chamber.Some notable mass fractions table (some aircraft included comparison purposes): Staging Thus far, required velocity (delta-v) achieve orbit unattainable single rocket propellant, tankage, structure, guidance, valves engines on, minimum percentage take-off mass great propellant carries achieve delta-v. Since Single-stage-to-orbit achievable, orbital rockets stage.For example, stage Saturn V, carrying weight upper stages, achieve mass ratio 10, achieved impulse 263 seconds. This delta-v 5.9 km/s 9.4 km/s delta-v needed achieve orbit losses allowed for.This problem frequently solved staging — rocket sheds excess weight (usually empty tankage associated engines) launch. Staging serial rockets stage fallen away, parallel, rockets burning detach burn out.The maximum speeds achieved staging theoretically limited speed light. However payload carried geometrically extra stage needed, additional delta-v stage simply additive. Acceleration thrust-to-weight ratio From Newton's second law, acceleration, {\displaystyle a} , vehicle simply: F {\displaystyle a{\frac {F_{n}}{m}}} Where instantaneous mass vehicle F {\displaystyle F_{n}} force acting rocket (mostly thrust air drag forces play part.)As remaining propellant decreases, rocket vehicles lighter acceleration increase propellant exhausted. This speed change occurs burn vehicle lighter. However, thrust throttled offset vary needed. Discontinuities acceleration occur stages burn out, starting lower acceleration stage firing.Peak accelerations increased designing vehicle reduced mass, achieved reduction fuel load tankage associated structures, reduces range, delta-v burn time. Still, applications rockets for, high peak acceleration applied short highly desirable.The minimal mass vehicle consists rocket engine minimal fuel structure carry it. In case thrust-to-weight ratio rocket engine limits maximum acceleration designed. It turns rocket engines generally excellent thrust weight ratios (137 NK-33 engine, solid rockets 1000), high-g vehicles employ employed rockets.The high accelerations rockets naturally possess rocket vehicles capable vertical takeoff, cases, suitable guidance control engines, vertical landing. For operations vehicle's engines local gravitational acceleration. Energy Energy efficiency Rocket launch vehicles take-off great deal flames, noise drama, grievously inefficient. However, perfect, energy efficiency bad supposed.The energy density typical rocket propellant one-third conventional hydrocarbon fuels; bulk mass (often inexpensive) oxidizer. Nevertheless, take-off rocket great deal energy fuel oxidizer stored vehicle. It course desirable energy propellant kinetic energy rocket possible.Energy fuel lost air drag gravity drag rocket altitude speed. However, lost energy exhaust.In chemical propulsion device, engine efficiency simply ratio kinetic power exhaust gases power chemical reaction: η 1 2 ˙ 2 η P {\displaystyle \eta _{c}{\frac {{\frac {1}{2}}{\dot {m}}v_{e}^{2}}{\eta _{combustion}P_{chem}}}} 100% efficiency engine (engine efficiency η 100 % {\displaystyle \eta _{c}100\%} ) heat energy combustion products converted kinetic energy jet. This possible, near-adiabatic high expansion ratio nozzles rockets surprisingly close: nozzle expands gas, gas cooled accelerated, energy efficiency 70% achieved. Most rest heat energy exhaust recovered. The high efficiency consequence fact rocket combustion performed high temperatures gas finally released lower temperatures, good Carnot efficiency.However, engine efficiency story. In common jet-based engines, rockets high typically fixed exhaust speeds, rocket vehicles extremely inefficient speeds irrespective engine efficiency. The problem speeds, exhaust carries huge amount kinetic energy rearward. This phenomenon termed propulsive efficiency ( η {\displaystyle \eta _{p}} ).However, speeds rise, resultant exhaust speed down, vehicle energetic efficiency rises, reaching peak 100% engine efficiency vehicle travelling exactly speed exhaust emitted. In case exhaust ideally dead space moving vehicle, energy, conservation energy, energy vehicle. The efficiency drops higher speeds exhaust travelling forwards- trailing vehicle.From principles propulsive efficiency η {\displaystyle \eta _{p}} rocket moving speed {\displaystyle u} exhaust velocity {\displaystyle c} is: η 2 1 + ( ) 2 {\displaystyle \eta _{p}{\frac {2{\frac {u}{c}}}{1+({\frac {u}{c}})^{2}}}} And (instantaneous) energy efficiency η {\displaystyle \eta } is: η η η {\displaystyle \eta \eta _{p}\eta _{c}} For example, equation, η {\displaystyle \eta _{c}} 0.7, rocket flying Mach 0.85 (which aircraft cruise at) exhaust velocity Mach 10, predicted energy efficiency 5.9%, conventional, modern, air-breathing jet engine achieves closer 35% efficiency. Thus rocket 6x energy; allowing energy rocket propellant third conventional air fuel, roughly 18x mass propellant carried journey. This rockets rarely general aviation.Since energy ultimately fuel, considerations rockets high speed required, ICBMs orbital launch. For example, NASA's space shuttle fires engines 8.5 minutes, consuming 1,000 tonnes solid propellant (containing 16% aluminium) additional 2,000,000 litres liquid propellant (106,261 liquid hydrogen fuel) lift 100,000 vehicle (including 25,000 payload) altitude 111 orbital velocity 30,000 km/h. At altitude velocity, vehicle kinetic energy 3 TJ energy roughly 200 GJ. Given initial energy 20 TJ, Space Shuttle 16% energy efficient launching orbiter.Thus jet engines, better match speed jet exhaust speed (such turbofans—in spite worse η {\displaystyle \eta _{c}} )—dominate subsonic supersonic atmospheric use, rockets work best hypersonic speeds. On hand, rockets serve short-range speed military applications low-speed inefficiency outweighed extremely high thrust high accelerations. Oberth One subtle feature rockets relates energy. A rocket stage, carrying load, capable delta-v. This delta-v speed increases (or decreases) amount, independent initial speed. However, kinetic energy square law speed, faster rocket travelling burn orbital energy loses.This fact interplanetary travel. It amount delta-v reach planets, reach escape velocity delta-v applied rocket travelling high speeds, close Earth planetary surface; waiting rocket slowed altitude multiplies effort required achieve desired trajectory. Safety, reliability accidents The reliability rockets, physical systems, dependent quality engineering design construction.Because enormous chemical energy rocket propellants (greater energy weight explosives, lower gasoline), consequences accidents severe. Most space missions problems. In 1986, Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, American physicist Richard Feynman, served Rogers Commission estimated chance unsafe condition launch Shuttle roughly 1%; historical person-flight risk orbital spaceflight calculated 2% 4%. Costs economics The costs rockets roughly divided propellant costs, costs obtaining and/or producing 'dry mass' rocket, costs required support equipment facilities.Most takeoff mass rocket propellant. However propellant seldom expensive gasoline kilogram (as 2009 gasoline $1/kg [$0.45/lb] less), amounts needed, cheapest rockets, turns propellant costs comparatively small, completely negligible. With liquid oxygen costing $0.15 kilogram ($0.068/lb) liquid hydrogen $2.20/kg ($1.00/lb), Space Shuttle 2009 liquid propellant expense $1.4 launch cost $450 expenses (with 40% mass propellants liquids external fuel tank, 60% solids SRBs).Even rocket's non-propellant, dry mass 5-20% total mass, cost dominates. For hardware performance orbital launch vehicles, expenses $2000–$10,000+ kilogram dry weight common, engineering, fabrication, testing; raw materials amount typically 2% total expense. For rockets reusable (shuttle engines) engines function minutes, simplifies design.Extreme performance requirements rockets reaching orbit correlate high cost, including intensive quality control ensure reliability despite limited safety factors allowable weight reasons. Components produced small numbers individually machined prevent amortization R&D facility costs mass production degree pedestrian manufacturing. Amongst liquid-fueled rockets, complexity influenced hardware lightweight, pressure-fed engines orders magnitude lesser count pump-fed engines lead weight needing greater tank pressure, small maneuvering thrusters consequence.To change preceding factors orbital launch vehicles, proposed methods included mass-producing simple rockets quantities scale, developing reusable rockets frequently amortize up-front expense payloads, reducing rocket performance requirements constructing hypothetical non-rocket spacelaunch system velocity orbit (or methods involving rocket use).The costs support equipment, range costs launch pads generally scale size rocket, vary launch rate, considered fixed cost.Rockets applications launch orbit (such military rockets rocket-assisted off), commonly needing comparable performance mass-produced, inexpensive.

Blackjack, twenty-one, played casino banking game world. Blackjack comparing card game player dealer, meaning players compete dealer players. It played decks 52 cards. The objective game beat dealer ways:Get 21 points player's cards (called "blackjack" "natural"), dealer blackjack;Reach final score higher dealer exceeding 21; orLet dealer draw additional cards exceeds 21.The player players dealt two-card cards. Face cards (kings, queens, jacks) counted points. A player dealer count 1 point 11 points. All cards counted numeric card. After receiving cards, players option "hit", additional card. In round, player dealer wins score 21 higher score 21. Scoring higher 21 (called "busting" "going bust") loss. A player final score equal 21 dealer busts. If player holds valued 11, called "soft", meaning player bust additional card; 11 card equal 21. Otherwise, "hard".The dealer cards total 17 points. (At tables dealer hits "soft" 17, i.e. cards totaling six.) Players busting total higher dealer's. The dealer loses busting lesser player busted. If player dealer total, called "push", player typically lose money hand. If players bust, automatically dealer play hand.Blackjack rule variations. Since 1960s, blackjack high-profile target advantage players, card counters, track profile cards dealt adapt wagers playing strategies accordingly.Blackjack inspired casino games, including Spanish 21 pontoon. History Blackjack's precursor twenty-one, game unknown origin. The written reference book Spanish author Miguel Cervantes, famous writing Don Quixote. Cervantes gambler, characters tale "Rinconete Cortadillo", Novelas Ejemplares, couple cheats working Seville. They proficient cheating ventiuna (Spanish twenty-one), object game reach 21 points going values 1 11. The game played Spanish baraja deck, lacks eights nines. This short story written 1601 1602, implying ventiuna played Castilla 17th century earlier. Later references game France Spain.When twenty-one introduced United States, gambling houses offered bonus payouts stimulate players' interest. One bonus ten-to-one payout player's consisted spades black jack (either jack clubs jack spades). This called "blackjack", stuck game ten-to-one bonus withdrawn. In modern game, blackjack refers face card suits colours. Rules play casinos At casino blackjack table, dealer faces playing positions semicircular table. Between standard 52-card decks shuffled together. At round, three players bets "betting box" position play. That is, three players position table jurisdictions allow betting. The player front betting box deemed control position, dealer consult controlling player playing decisions hand; players box "play behind". Any player allowed control boxes desired single table, prohibited individual play table multiple bets single box. In U.S. casinos, however, players limited playing three positions table person allowed position.The dealer deals cards his/her left (the position dealer's left referred "first base") his/her ("third base"). Each box dealt initial cards visible people playing it, players. The dealer's receives card face up, "hole card" games receives second card face (the card), dealer peeks reveal dealer's blackjack. Hole card games played tables small mirror electronic sensor peek securely card. In European casinos, "no card" games prevalent; dealer's second card drawn consulted players played hands.Cards dealt handheld decks, dealer's shoe, shuffling machine. Single cards dealt wagered-on position clockwise dealer's left, single card dealer, additional card positions play. The players' initial cards dealt face face (more common single-deck games).The players' object money creating card totals turn higher dealer's exceed 21 ("busting"/"breaking"), alternatively allowing dealer additional cards he/she busts.

Non-controlling players double wager decline so, bound controlling player's decision card.Signal: Place additional chips original betting box, point finger.Split: If cards value, player split hands, moving second equal area betting box. The dealer separates cards draws additional card each, placing hand. The player plays separate hands turn; restrictions, hands treated independent hands, player winning losing wager separately hand. Occasionally, case ten-valued cards, casinos allow splitting cards identical ranks; instance, 10-10 split, 10-king. However, 10-value cards treated same. Doubling splitting post-split hands restricted, blackjacks split counted non-blackjack 21 comparing dealer's hand. Hitting split aces allowed. Non-controlling players controlling player putting additional decline so, associating existing wager post-split hands. In case choose play second cards drawn.

Insurance If dealer's upcard ace, player offered option "insurance" dealer checks card.Insurance dealer blackjack treated independently wager. It pays 2:1 (meaning player receives dollars dollar bet) dealer's exposed card ace. The idea dealer's second card fairly high probability (nearly one-third) ten-valued, dealer blackjack disappointment player. It attractive (although wise) player insure possibility dealer blackjack making maximum "insurance" bet, case "insurance proceeds" concomitant loss original bet. The player half original insurance extra chips portion table marked "Insurance pays 2 1".Players blackjack insurance, maximum insurance commit winning amount exactly equal wager, dealer's outcome.

However insurance outcome anti-correlated wager, player's priority reduce variation, choose pay this.Furthermore, insurance susceptible advantage play. It advantageous insurance card chance three ten. Advantage play techniques identify situations. In multi-hand, face-up, single deck game, establish insurance good simply observing cards table deal; 2 player hands exposed, initial cards ten, 16 47 remaining cards tens, larger 1 3, insurance good bet. This elementary example family advantage play techniques card counting.Bets insure blackjack advantageous insurance bets general, player's blackjack dealer blackjack too. Rule variations consequences house edge The rules casino blackjack generally determined law regulation, establishes rule variations allowed discretion casino. The rules game generally posted table, failing expectation casino staff request. Over 100 variations blackjack documented.As casino games, blackjack incorporates "house edge", statistical advantage casino built game. The advantage dealer's position blackjack player fact player busts, player loses, dealer subsequently busts. Nonetheless, blackjack players basic strategy lose 1% total wagered amount strictly average luck; favorable player compared casino games. The loss rate players deviate basic strategy ignorance generally expected greater.Dealer hits soft 17Each game rule dealer stand soft 17, generally printed table surface. The variation dealer soft 17 abbreviated "H17" blackjack literature, "S17" stand-on-soft-17 variation. Substituting "H17" rule "S17" rule game benefits player, decreasing house edge 0.2%.Number decksAll things equal, fewer decks decreases house edge. This reflects increased likelihood player blackjack, players draws card, subsequent probability drawing higher fewer decks. It reflects decreased likelihood blackjack-blackjack push game fewer decks.Casinos generally compensate tightening rules games fewer decks, order preserve house edge discourage play altogether. When offering single deck blackjack games, casinos disallow doubling soft hands splitting, restrict resplitting, require higher minimum bets, pay player 3:2 winning blackjack.The table illustrates mathematical house edge number decks, considering games deck counts ruleset: double split allowed, resplit hands allowed, hitting split aces, surrender, double cards, original bets lost dealer blackjack, dealer hits soft 17, cut-card used. The increase house edge unit increase number decks dramatic comparing single deck game two-deck game, progressively smaller decks added.Late/early surrenderSurrender, games allow it, permitted dealer blackjack; dealer's card ten, card checked blackjack surrender offered. This rule protocol consequently "late" surrender. The alternative, "early" surrender, player option surrender dealer checks blackjack, no-hole-card game. Early surrender favorable player surrender. Most medium-strength hands surrendered dealer Ace card checked.For surrender, however, tempting surrender lose, correct strategy surrender worst hands, chance winning better losing half pushing half, entailed surrendering.ResplittingIf cards post-split value, games allow player split again, "resplit". The player places wager dealer separates pair dealing card before. Some games allow unlimited resplitting, limit number hands, hands (for example, "resplit 4").Hit/resplit split acesAfter splitting aces, common rule card dealt ace; player split, double, hand. Rule variants include allowing resplitting aces allowing player split aces. Games allowing aces resplit uncommon, allowing player split aces extremely rare. Allowing player hands split aces reduces house edge 0.13%; allowing resplitting aces reduces house edge 0.03%. Note ten-value card dealt split (or vice versa) "soft 21" "natural".No double splitAfter split, games allow doubling two-card hands. Disallowing doubling split increases house edge 0.12%.Double 9/10/11 10/11 onlyUnder "Reno rule", double permitted totals 9, 10, 11 (under European rule, 10 11). Basic strategy doubling 9 soft 13–18, advanced players identify situations doubling soft 19–20 8,7 6 advantageous. The Reno rule prevents player advantage double situations increases player's expected loss. The Reno rule increases house edge 1000, European version 1000.No card OBOIn non-U.S. casinos, 'no card' game played, meaning dealer draw consult second card players finished making decisions. With card, correct basic strategy double split dealer ace, dealer blackjack loss split double bets; exception pair A's dealer 10, correct split. In cases, stand, surrender called for. For instance, holding 11 dealer 10, correct strategy double card game (where player dealer's second card ace), card game. The card rule adds 0.11% house edge.The "original bets only" rule variation appearing card games player's loses dealer blackjack, mandatory initial ("original") forfeited, optional bets, meaning doubles splits, pushed. "Original bets only" acronym OBO; basic strategy house edge reverting card game.Altered payout winning blackjackIn casinos, blackjack pays 6:5 1:1 3:2. This tables lowest table minimums single-deck games. Among common rule variations U.S., altered payouts blackjack damaging player, causing greatest increase house edge. Since blackjack occurs 4.8% hands, 1:1 game increases house edge 2.3%, 6:5 game adds 1.4% house edge. Video blackjack machines generally pay 1:1 payout blackjack. The 6:5 rule commonly employed table blackjack single deck games, help house compensate house edge intrinsic deck only.Dealer wins tiesThe rule bets tied hands lost pushed catastrophic player. Though rarely standard blackjack, "blackjack-like" games charity casinos. Blackjack strategy Basic strategy Each blackjack game basic strategy, playing total dealer's up-card, loses money house term.An example basic strategy table below, includes parameters:Four decksThe dealer stands soft 17A double allowed splitOnly original bets lost dealer blackjackKey:S StandH HitDh Double (if allowed, hit)Ds Double (if allowed, stand)SP SplitSU Surrender (if allowed, hit)The bulk basic strategy common blackjack games, rule variations calling changes situations. For example, game soft 17 rule, common Las Vegas Strip casinos, 6 cells table changed: double 11 vs. A, surrender 15 17 vs. A, double A,7 vs. 2, double A,8 vs. 6, surrender (if allowed, hit) 8,8 vs. A. Also playing basic strategy insurance "even money."Estimates house edge blackjack games quoted casinos gaming regulators generally based assumption players basic strategy systematically change size.Most blackjack games house edge 0.5% 1%, placing blackjack cheapest casino table games. Casino promotions complimentary matchplay vouchers 2:1 blackjack payouts allow player acquire advantage deviating basic strategy. Composition-dependent strategy Basic strategy based player's point total dealer's visible card. Players improve decision considering precise composition hand, point total. For example, players ordinarily stand holding 12 dealer 4. However, single deck game, players 12 consists 10 2. The presence 10 player's consequences:It player's 12 worse stand (since avoid losing dealer bust, fewer 10s left shoe).It hitting safer, going bust draw 10, 10 hand.However, basic composition-dependent strategy lead actions, difference expected reward small, smaller decks. Using composition-dependent strategy basic strategy single deck game reduces house edge 4 10,000, falls 3 100,000 six-deck game. Advantage play Blackjack high-profile target advantage players 1960s. Advantage play attempt skills memory, computation, observation. These techniques, generally legal, powerful player long-term edge game, making undesirable customer casino leading ejection blacklisting detected. The techniques advantage play blackjack follows: Card counting During course blackjack shoe, dealer exposes dealt cards. Careful accounting exposed cards allows player inferences cards remain dealt. These inferences ways:Players larger bets advantage. For example, players increase starting aces tens left deck, hope hitting blackjack.Players deviate basic strategy composition undealt cards.

When card exposed, counter adds score card running total, 'count'. A card counter count betting playing decisions table learned. The count starts 0 freshly shuffled deck "balanced" counting systems. Unbalanced counts started depends number decks game.Blackjack's house edge 0.5%–1% players basic strategy. Card counting player edge 2% house.Card counting rewarding complete shoe cards remain. Single-deck games susceptible card counting. As result, casinos insist players reveal cards single-deck games. In games decks cards, casinos limit penetration shoe reshuffling decks remain undealt. Casinos shuffling machine reintroduce exhausted cards deck played.Card counting legal considered cheating counter external device, casino realizes player counting, casino longer play blackjack.

Historically, profitability lending activities cyclical dependent strengths loan customers stage economic cycle. Fees financial advice constitute stable revenue stream banks emphasis revenue lines smooth financial performance.In 20 years, American banks measures ensure remain profitable responding increasingly changing market conditions.First, includes Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, allows banks merge investment insurance houses. Merging banking, investment, insurance functions allows traditional banks respond increasing consumer demands "one-stop shopping" enabling cross-selling products (which, banks hope, increase profitability).Second, expanded risk-based pricing business lending consumer lending, charging higher interest rates customers considered higher credit risk increased chance default loans. This helps offset losses bad loans, lowers price loans better credit histories, offers credit products high risk customers denied credit.Third, sought increase methods payment processing general public business clients.

Central banks typically monopoly business issuing banknotes. However, countries case. In UK, example, Financial Services Authority licenses banks, commercial banks (such Bank Scotland) issue banknotes addition issued Bank England, UK government's central bank.Banking law based contractual analysis relationship bank (defined above) customer—defined entity bank agrees conduct account.The law implies rights obligations relationship follows:The bank account balance financial position bank customer: account credit, bank owes balance customer; account overdrawn, customer owes balance bank.The bank agrees pay customer's checks amount standing credit customer's account, agreed overdraft limit.The bank pay customer's account mandate customer, e.g. cheque drawn customer.The bank agrees collect cheques deposited customer's account customer's agent, credit proceeds customer's account.The bank combine customer's accounts, account aspect credit relationship.The bank lien cheques deposited customer's account, extent customer indebted bank.The bank disclose details transactions customer's account—unless customer consents, public duty disclose, bank's interests require it, law demands it.The bank close customer's account reasonable notice, cheques outstanding ordinary course business days.These implied contractual terms modified express agreement customer bank. The statutes regulations force jurisdiction modify terms and/or create rights, obligations limitations relevant bank-customer relationship.Some types financial institution, building societies credit unions, partly wholly exempt bank license requirements, regulated separate rules.The requirements issue bank license vary jurisdictions typically include:Minimum capitalMinimum capital ratio'Fit Proper' requirements bank's controllers, owners, directors, senior officersApproval bank's business plan prudent plausible. Types banksEdit Banks' activities divided into:retail banking, dealing directly individuals small businesses;business banking, providing services mid-market business;corporate banking, directed business entities;private banking, providing wealth management services high-net-worth individuals families;investment banking, relating activities financial markets.Most banks profit-making, private enterprises. However, owned government, non-profit organizations. Types banksEdit Commercial banks: term bank distinguish investment bank. After Great Depression, U.S. Congress required banks engage banking activities, investment banks limited capital market activities. Since longer separate ownership, term "commercial bank" refer bank division bank deals deposits loans corporations businesses.Community banks: locally operated financial institutions empower employees local decisions serve customers partners.Community development banks: regulated banks financial services credit under-served markets populations.Land development banks: The banks providing long-term loans called land development banks (LDB). The history LDB old. The LDB started Jhang Punjab 1920. The objective LDBs promote development land, agriculture increase agricultural production. The LDBs long-term finance members directly branches.Credit unions co-operative banks: not-for-profit cooperatives owned depositors offering rates favourable for-profit banks. Typically, membership restricted employees company, residents defined area, members union religious organizations, families.Postal savings banks: savings banks associated national postal systems.Private banks: banks manage assets high-net-worth individuals. Historically minimum USD 1 required open account, however, years private banks lowered entry hurdles USD 350,000 private investors.Offshore banks: banks located jurisdictions taxation regulation. Many offshore banks essentially private banks.Savings bank: Europe, savings banks roots 19th 18th century. Their original objective easily accessible savings products strata population. In countries, savings banks created public initiative; others, socially committed individuals created foundations infrastructure. Nowadays, European savings banks focus retail banking: payments, savings products, credits insurances individuals small medium-sized enterprises. Apart retail focus, commercial banks broadly decentralized distribution network, providing local regional outreach—and socially responsible approach business society.Building societies Landesbanks: institutions conduct retail banking.Ethical banks: banks prioritize transparency operations consider socially responsible investments.A direct internet-only bank banking operation physical bank branches, conceived implemented wholly networked computers. Types investment banksEdit Investment banks "underwrite" (guarantee sale of) stock bond issues, trade accounts, markets, investment management, advise corporations capital market activities mergers acquisitions.Merchant banks traditionally banks engaged trade finance. The modern definition, however, refers banks capital firms shares loans. Unlike venture caps, invest companies. Both combinedEdit Universal banks, commonly financial services companies, engage activities. These big banks diversified groups that, services, distribute insurance— term bancassurance, portmanteau combining "banque bank" "assurance", signifying banking insurance provided corporate entity. Other types banksEdit Central banks government-owned charged quasi-regulatory responsibilities, supervising commercial banks, controlling cash interest rate. They generally liquidity banking system lender resort event crisis.Islamic banks adhere concepts Islamic law. This banking revolves well-established principles based Islamic canons. All banking activities avoid interest, concept forbidden Islam. Instead, bank earns profit (markup) fees financing facilities extends customers. Challenges banking industryEdit United StatesEdit The United States banking industry heavily regulated guarded world, multiple specialized focused regulators. All banks FDIC-insured deposits Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) regulator. However, soundness examinations (i.e., bank operating sound manner), Federal Reserve primary federal regulator Fed-member banks; Office Comptroller Currency (OCC) primary federal regulator national banks; Office Thrift Supervision, OTS, primary federal regulator thrifts. State non-member banks examined agencies well FDIC. National banks primary regulator—the OCC.Each regulatory agency set rules regulations banks thrifts adhere. The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) established 1979 formal inter-agency empowered prescribe uniform principles, standards, report forms federal examination financial institutions. Although FFIEC greater degree regulatory consistency agencies, rules regulations constantly changing.In addition changing regulations, changes industry led consolidations Federal Reserve, FDIC, OTS, OCC. Offices closed, supervisory regions merged, staff levels reduced budgets cut. The remaining regulators face increased burden increased workload banks regulator. While banks struggle changes regulatory environment, regulators struggle manage workload effectively regulate banks. The impact changes banks receiving hands-on assessment regulators, spent institution, problems slipping cracks, increase bank failures United States.The changing economic environment impact banks thrifts struggle effectively manage interest rate spread face rates loans, rate competition deposits general market changes, industry trends economic fluctuations. It challenge banks effectively set growth strategies economic market. A rising interest rate environment help financial institutions, changes consumers businesses predictable challenge remains banks grow effectively manage spread generate return shareholders.The management banks’ asset portfolios remains challenge today’s economic environment. Loans bank’s primary asset category loan quality suspect, foundation bank shaken core. While issue banks, declining asset quality big problem financial institutions.There reasons this, lax attitude banks years “good times.” The exacerbated reduction regulatory oversight banks cases depth management. Problems undetected, impact bank discovered. In addition, banks, business, struggle cut costs consequently eliminated expenses, adequate employee training programs.Banks face host challenges ageing ownership groups. Across country, banks’ management teams board directors ageing. Banks face ongoing pressure shareholders, public private, achieve earnings growth projections. Regulators pressure banks manage categories risk. Banking extremely competitive industry. Competing financial services industry tougher entrance players insurance agencies, credit unions, cheque cashing services, credit card companies, etc.As reaction, banks developed activities financial instruments, financial market operations brokerage big players activities. Loan activities banksEdit To buyers builders funds needed, banks compete deposits. The phenomenon disintermediation dollars moving savings accounts direct market instruments U.S. Department Treasury obligations, agency securities, corporate debt. One greatest factors years movement deposits tremendous growth money market funds higher interest rates attracted consumer deposits.To compete deposits, US savings institutions offer types plans:Passbook ordinary deposit accounts — permit amount withdrawn account time.NOW Super NOW accounts — function checking accounts earn interest. A minimum balance required Super NOW accounts.Money market accounts — carry monthly limit preauthorized transfers accounts persons require minimum average balance.Certificate accounts — subject loss interest withdrawals maturity.Notice accounts — equivalent certificate accounts indefinite term. Savers agree notify institution withdrawal.Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) Keogh plans — retirement savings funds deposited interest earned exempt income tax withdrawal.Checking accounts — offered institutions definite restrictions.All withdrawals deposits completely sole decision responsibility account owner guardian required legal reasons.Club accounts savings accounts — designed help people save regularly meet goals. Accounting bank accountsEdit Bank statements accounting records produced banks accounting standards world. Under GAAP kinds accounts: debit credit. Credit accounts Revenue, Equity Liabilities. Debit Accounts Assets Expenses. The bank credits credit account increase balance, debits credit account decrease balance.The customer debits savings/bank (asset) account ledger making deposit (and account debit), customer credits credit card (liability) account ledger spends money (and account credit). When customer reads bank statement, statement credit account deposits, debits withdrawals funds. The customer positive balance balance reflected credit balance bank statement. If customer overdrawn, negative balance, reflected debit balance bank statement. Brokered depositsEdit One source deposits banks brokers deposit sums money behalf investors trust corporations. This money generally banks offer favourable terms, better offered local depositors. It bank engage business local deposits all, funds brokered deposits. Accepting quantity deposits, "hot money" called, puts bank difficult risky position, funds lent invested yields return pay high interest paid brokered deposits. This risky decisions eventual failure bank. Banks failed 2008 2009 United States global financial crisis had, average, brokered deposits percent deposits average bank. Such deposits, combined risky estate investments, factored savings loan crisis 1980s. Regulation brokered deposits opposed banks grounds practice source external funding growing communities insufficient local deposits. There types accounts: saving, recurring current accounts. Globalization banking industryEdit In modern huge reductions barriers global competition banking industry. Increases telecommunications financial technologies, Bloomberg, allowed banks extend reach world, longer customers manage finances risk. The growth cross-border activities increased demand banks services borders nationalities. However, despite reductions barriers growth cross-border activities, banking industry globalized industries. In USA, instance, banks worry Riegle–Neal Act, promotes efficient interstate banking. In vast majority nations globe market share foreign owned banks currently tenth market shares banks nation. One reason banking industry globalized convenient local banks loans small business individuals. On hand, corporations, nation bank in, corporation's financial globe.

Discounts allowances reductions basic price goods services.They occur distribution channel, modifying manufacturer's list price (determined manufacturer printed package), retail price (set retailer attached product sticker), list price (which quoted buyer, written form).There purposes discounting, including increase short-term sales, move out-of-date stock, reward valuable customers, encourage distribution channel members perform function, reward behaviors benefit discount issuer. Some discounts allowances forms sales promotion. Types The common types discounts allowances listed below. Dealing payment Prompt payment discount Trade Discounts deductions price wholesaler manufacturer retailer list price catalogue price. Cash Discounts reductions price creditor debitor motivate debitor payment . These discounts intended speed payment liquidity firm. They promotional device. explain discount relaxation price. Examples 2/10 30 buyer pay 30 days invoice date, receive 2% discount pay 10 days invoice date.3/7 EOM buyer receive cash discount 3% bill paid 7 days month indicated invoice date. If invoice received 25th day month, payment 7th day calendar month. If proper invoice received 25th day month, payment 7th day second calendar month.3/7 EOM 30 buyer pay 30 days invoice date, receive 3% discount pay 7 days month indicated invoice date. If invoice received 25th day month, payment 7th day calendar month. If proper invoice received 25th day month, payment 7th day second calendar month.2/15 40 ROG buyer pay 40 days receipt goods, receive 2% discount paid 15 days invoice date. (ROG short "Receipt goods.") Preferred payment method discount Some retailers (particularly small retailers margins) offer discounts customers paying cash, avoid paying fees credit card transactions. Partial payment discount Similar Trade discount, seller wishes improve cash flow liquidity, finds buyer typically unable meet desired discount deadline. A partial discount payment buyer helps seller's cash flow partially. Sliding scale A discount offered based one's ability pay. More common non-profit organizations for-profit retail. Forward dating This purchaser doesn’t pay goods well arrive. The invoice moved forward example: purchase goods November sale December holiday season, payment invoice January 27. Seasonal discount These price reductions order slack period (example: purchasing skis April northern hemisphere, September southern hemisphere). On shorter scale, happy hour fall category. Generally, discount referred "X-Dating" "Ex-Dating". An example X-Dating be:3/7 30 extra 10 buyer pay 30 days invoice date, receive 3% discount pay 7 days month indicated invoice extra 10 days. Dealing trade Bargaining Bargaining seller buyer negotiate price original price. Trade discount Trade discounts, called functional discounts, payments distribution channel members performing function. Examples functions warehousing shelf stocking. Trade discounts combined include series functions, example 20/12/5 indicate 20% discount warehousing product, additional 12% discount shipping product, additional 5% discount keeping shelves stocked. Trade discounts frequent industries retailers hold majority power distribution channel (referred channel captains).Trade discounts increase volume sales supplier.The discount described trade rate discount called "trade discount". Trade discount discount allowed retail price product something. e.g. Retail price cream 25 trade discount 2% 25. Trade rate discount A trade rate discount, called "trade discount", offered seller buyer purposes trade reselling, user. For example, pharmacist offer discount over-the-counter drugs physicians purchasing dispensing physicians' patients. A seller supplying trade resellers, general public general list price anybody, offer trade discount bona-fide trade customers. Trade-in credit Trade-in credit, called trade-up credit, discount credit granted return something. The returned item monetary value, version newer item bought, worth reselling second-hand. The idea seller's viewpoint offer discount buyer showing "counter action" earn discount. Sellers discount granted "given free" future price/value negotiations easier. Buyers advantage longer used. Examples industries. Dealing quantity These price reductions purchases. The rationale economies scale pass (or all) savings customer. In industries, buyer groups co-ops formed advantage discounts. Generally types: Cumulative quantity discount Cumulative quantity discounts, called accumulation discounts, price reductions based quantity purchased set period time. The expectation impose implied switching cost bond purchaser seller. Non-cumulative quantity discount These price reductions based quantity single order. The expectation encourage larger orders, reducing billing, order filling, shipping, sales personnel expenses. Dependence price quantity An extreme quantity discount occurs when, quantity range, price depend quantity:if minimum amount pay minimum amount anywayif amount fixed amounts offer, pay higher amountThese apply case service "quantity" referring time. For example, entrance ticket zoo day; stays shorter, price same. It kind pass unlimited service day, distinguish not, leaving returning, pay again. Similarly pass period.

The IBM Personal Computer, commonly IBM PC, original version progenitor IBM PC compatible hardware platform. It IBM model number 5150, introduced August 12, 1981. It created team engineers designers direction Don Estridge IBM Entry Systems Division Boca Raton, Florida.The generic term "personal computer" 1981, applied 1972 Xerox PARC's Alto, IBM Personal Computer, term "PC" desktop microcomputer compatible IBM's PC products. Within short introduction, third-party suppliers peripheral devices, expansion cards, software proliferated; influence IBM PC personal computer market standardizing platform personal computers. "IBM compatible" criterion sales growth; Apple Macintosh family market share compatibility IBM personal computer. History Rumors International Business Machines (IBM), world's largest companies, 62% share mainframe computer market 1981. Its share computer market, however, declined 60% 1970 32% 1980. Perhaps distracted long-running antitrust lawsuit, "Colossus Armonk" completely missed fast-growing minicomputer market 1970s, rivals Wang, Hewlett-Packard (HP), Control Data areas.In 1979 BusinessWeek asked, "Is IBM stodgy, mature company?" By 1981 stock price declined 22%. IBM's earnings half year grew 5.3%—one third inflation rate—while minicomputer maker Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) grew 35%. The company began selling minicomputers, January 1982 United States Department Justice ended antitrust suit because, The New York Times reported, government "recognized computer experts securities analysts concluded: I.B.M. longer dominates computer business".IBM wished avoid outcome personal computer industry, dominated Commodore PET, Atari 8-bit family, Apple II, Tandy Corporation's TRS-80, CP/M machines. With $150 sales 1979 projected annual growth 40% 1980s, microcomputer market IBM's attention. Other technology companies HP, Texas Instruments, Data General entered it, IBM customers buying Apples, company introducing personal computer experiment market defense rivals, small.In 1980 1981 rumors spread IBM personal computer, miniaturized version IBM System/370, Matsushita acknowledged discussed IBM possibility manufacturing personal computer American company. The Japanese project, codenamed "Go", ended 1981 release American-designed IBM PC codenamed "Chess", simultaneous projects confused rumors forthcoming product. Too late? Data General Texas Instruments' small computers successful, observers expected AT&T enter computer industry, companies Exxon, Montgomery Ward, Pentel, Sony designing microcomputers. Whether IBM waited enter industry Apple unclear.An observer stated "IBM bringing personal computer teaching elephant tap dance." Successful microcomputer company Vector Graphic's fiscal 1980 revenue $12 million. A single IBM computer 1960s cost $9 million, occupied quarter acre air-conditioned space, staff 60 people; 1980 least-expensive computer, 5120, cost $13,500. The company sold internal sales force, experience resellers retail stores, introduce product designed work non-IBM equipment 1980.Another observer claimed IBM decisions slowly that, tested, "what months ship empty box". As computer companies, products typically required years development. IBM learn develop, mass-produce, market computers. While company traditionally pioneer market—IBM released commercial computer year Remington Rand's UNIVAC 1951, years 85% market—the personal-computer development pricing cycles faster mainframes, products designed months obsolete quickly.Many microcomputer industry resented IBM's power wealth, disliked perception industry founded startups needed latecomer staid strict dress code employee songbook. The microcomputers company prestigious, popular American companies stated "No fired buying IBM", clear. InfoWorld, described "The Newsweekly Microcomputer Users", stated "for grandmother, millions people her, IBM computer synonymous". Byte ("The Small Systems Journal") stated editorial announcement IBM PC:Rumors abound personal computers giants Digital Equipment Corporation General Electric Company. But contest. IBM's personal computer ... star, features, exists all. When number company Fortune 500 enters field, news ... The influence personal computer company literally "computer" contemplate.The editorial acknowledged "some factions industry looked IBM 'enemy'", concluded optimism: "I personal computing giant step." Predecessors Desktop sized programmable calculators Hewlett Packard evolved HP 9830 BASIC language computer 1972. In 1972–1973 team led Dr. Paul Friedl IBM Los Gatos Scientific Center developed portable computer prototype called SCAMP (Special Computer APL Machine Portable) based IBM PALM processor Philips compact cassette drive, small CRT, full-function keyboard. SCAMP emulated IBM 1130 minicomputer APL\1130. In 1973 APL generally mainframe computers, desktop sized microcomputers Wang 2200 HP 9800 offered BASIC. Because emulate APL\1130 performance portable, single-user computer, PC Magazine 1983 designated SCAMP "revolutionary concept" "the world's personal computer". The prototype Smithsonian Institution. A non-working industrial design model created 1973 illustrating SCAMP engineering prototype transformed usable product design marketplace. IBM executive Bill Lowe engineering prototype design model efforts demonstrate viability creating single-user computer.Successful demonstrations 1973 SCAMP prototype led IBM 5100 portable microcomputer 1975. In 1960s machine desks weighed half ton. The 5100 complete computer system programmable BASIC APL, small built-in CRT monitor, keyboard, tape drive data storage. It expensive, US$20,000; computer designed professional scientific customers, business users hobbyists. BYTE 1975 announced 5100 headline "Welcome, IBM, personal computing", PC Magazine 1984 described 5100s "little mainframes" stated "as personal computers, machines dismal failures ... antithesis user-friendly", IBM support third-party software. Despite news reports IBM product model number, PC introduced 1981 designated IBM 5150, putting "5100" series architecture directly descended IBM 5100. Later models trend: For example, IBM Portable Personal Computer, PC/XT, PC AT IBM machine types 5155, 5160, 5170, respectively.Following SCAMP, IBM Boca Raton Laboratory created single-user computer design concepts support Lowe's ongoing effort convince IBM strategic opportunity personal computer business. A selection IBM design concepts created infancy personal computing highlighted book ‘’DELETE: A Design History Computer Vapourware.‘’ One concept 1977, code-named Aquarius, working prototype utilizing advanced bubble memory cartridges. While design powerful smaller Apple II launched year, advanced bubble technology deemed unstable mass production. Project Chess Some employees opposed IBM entering market. One said, "Why earth care personal computer? It office automation." "Besides", added, "all embarrassment IBM". The company determined studying market years, building prototypes 1970s, IBM unable internally build personal computer profitably.IBM President John Opel skeptical personal computers. He CEO Frank Cary created dozen semi-autonomous "Independent Business Units" (IBU) encourage innovation; Fortune called "How start company leaving IBM". After Lowe head Entry Level Systems IBU Boca Raton team researched market. Computer dealers interested selling IBM product, told Lowe company design, sell, service IBM done. An IBM microcomputer, said, composed standard parts store employees repair. While dealers disliked Apple's business practices, including shortage Apple II company focused sophisticated Apple III, alternative doubted IBM's traditional sales methods bureaucracy change.Atari 1980 proposed original equipment manufacturer IBM microcomputer. Aware company needed enter market quickly—even schools Broward County, Boca Raton, purchased Apples—in July 1980 Lowe Opel, Cary, Corporate Management Committee. Lowe demonstrated proposal industrial design model based Atari 800 platform, suggested acquiring Atari "because culture IBM".Cary agreed culture, observing IBM "four years three people" develop personal computer; Lowe, however, promised year traditional IBM methods. Instead acquiring Atari, committee allowed independent group employees—"the Dirty Dozen", led engineer Bill Sydnes—which, Lowe promised, design prototype 30 days. The crude prototype barely worked demonstrated August, Lowe presented detailed business plan proposed computer open architecture, non-proprietary components software, sold retail stores, contrary IBM practice.The committee agreed Lowe's approach succeed. With Opel's support, October approved turning group IBU codenamed "Project Chess" develop "Acorn", unusually funding help achieve goal introducing product year August demonstration. After Lowe's promotion Don Estridge head Chess, January 1981 team demonstration computer IBM. Other members included Sydnes, Lewis Eggebrecht, David Bradley, Mark Dean, David O'Connor. Many hobbyists owned computers including Estridge, Apple II. After team received permission expand 150 1980, received 500 calls day IBM employees interested joining IBU. Open standards IBM vertically integrated, internally developing hardware software discouraging customers purchasing third-party products compatible IBM products. For PC company avoided possible; choosing, example, license Microsoft BASIC despite BASIC mainframes. Although company denied so, observers concluded IBM intentionally emulated Apple designing PC. The Apple II owners team influenced decision design computer open architecture publish technical create software expansion slot peripherals.Although company knew avoid competition third-party software proprietary hardware—Digital Research released CP/M-86 IBM Displaywriter, example—it considered IBM 801 RISC processor operating system, developed Thomas J. Watson Research Center Yorktown Heights, New York. The 801 processor order magnitude powerful Intel 8088, operating system advanced PC DOS 1.0 operating system Microsoft. Ruling in-house solution team’s job easier avoided delay schedule, ultimate consequences decision IBM far-reaching.IBM developed Datamaster business microcomputer, processor chips Intel; familiarity availability 8088 reason choosing PC. The 62-pin expansion bus slots designed Datamaster slots. Differences Datamaster included avoiding all-in-one design limiting computer's size fit standard desktop keyboard (also Datamaster's), 5.25" disk drives 8". Delays in-house development Datamaster software reason IBM chose Microsoft BASIC—already 8088—and published technical encourage third-party developers. IBM chose 8088 superior 8086 Intel offered better price units, 8088's 8-bit bus reduced cost rest computer.The design computer essentially complete April 1981, manufacturing team project. IBM hardware profit "Acorn". To save money, IBU built machine commercial off-the-shelf parts original equipment manufacturers possible, assembly occurring Boca Raton. The IBU decide economical "Make Buy" manufacturing step. Various IBM divisions competed outsiders build parts computer; North Carolina IBM factory built keyboard, Endicott, New York factory lower bid printed circuit boards, Taiwanese company built monitor. The IBU chose existing monitor IBM Japan Epson printer. Because off-the-shelf parts system unit keyboard unique IBM industrial design elements, IBM copyright appears ROM BIOS company logo, company reportedly received patents PC.Because product carry IBM logo, corporate division IBU bypass Quality Assurance Unit. Another aspect IBM change emphasis secrecy. Those working project strict confidentiality agreements. When individual mentioned public Saturday company working software IBM computer, IBM security appeared company Monday investigate leak. Developers received prototype computers boxes lined lead block X-rays sealed solder, locked, windowless rooms; develop software Microsoft emulated PC DEC minicomputer prototype debugging. After PC's debut, IBM Boca Raton employees continued decline discuss jobs public. One writer compared "silence" role company "hit[ting] wall Boston Marathon: conversation over". Debut IBM product personal interest in. It's tool desk, child's schoolroom. It surprising difference work, learn approach complexities (and simple pleasures) living.It's computer we're making you.After developing 12 months—faster hardware product company history—IBM announced Personal Computer 12 August 1981. Pricing started US$1,565 (equivalent $4,123 2016) configuration 16K RAM, Color Graphics Adapter, disk drives. The company intentionally set prices configurations comparable Apple rivals; analyst stated IBM "has gloves off", company "we [the PC's price] invites comparison". Microsoft, Personal Software, Peachtree Software developers launch titles, including EasyWriter VisiCalc. In addition existing corporate sales force IBM opened Product Center retail stores. After studying Apple's distribution network, company sold others, ComputerLand Sears Roebuck. Because retail stores receive revenue repairing computers providing warranty service, IBM broke 70-year tradition permitting training non-IBM service personnel PC.BYTE described IBM "the strongest marketing organization world", PC's marketing differed products. The company aware corporate reputation customers; advertisement began "Presenting IBM Personal Computers". The advertisements emphasized novelty individual owning IBM computer, describing "a product personal interest in" readers "'My IBM computer. Imagine ... yours. For business, project, department, class, family and, indeed, yourself." The Little Tramp After considering Alan Alda, Beverly Sills, Kermit Frog, Billy Martin celebrity endorsers IBM chose Charlie Chaplin's The Little Tramp character—played Billy Scudder—for series advertisements based Chaplin's films. The popular award-winning $36-million marketing campaign star Modern Times—a film expresses Chaplin's opposition big business, mechanization, technological efficiency—the (as Creative Computing described him) "warm cuddly" mascot world's largest companies.Chaplin character associated IBM—Time stated "The Tramp ... [it] human face"—that bowler cane represent satirize company. Although Chaplin estate sued Otrona trademark permission, PC Magazine's April 1983 issue 12 advertisements referred Little Tramp. Third-party products "We encourage third-part suppliers [for PC] ... delighted them", IBM stated. It sell internally developed PC software April 1984, relying established software companies. The company contacted Microsoft official approval Chess, received cooperation was, writer said, "unheard of" IBM. Such openness surprised observers; BYTE called "striking" "startling", developer reported "it's IBM." Another "They open helpful technical needed. The feeling radically different—it's stepping warm breeze." He concluded, "After years hassling—fighting Not-Invented-Here attitude—we're gods."Most personal-computer companies disclose technical details; Texas Instruments, example, intentionally developing third-party TI 99/4A software difficult, requiring lockout chip cartridges. IBM mainframe technology secret rivals indicted industrial espionage. For PC, however, IBM released detailed information. The US$36 IBM PC Technical Reference Manual included complete circuit schematics, commented ROM BIOS source code, engineering programming IBM's PC-related hardware, instructions designing third-party peripherals. It comprehensive reviewer suggested manual serve university textbook, clear developer claimed design expansion card physical computer.IBM marketed technical manual full-page color print advertisements, stating "our software story written. Maybe you". Sydnes stated "The definition personal computer third-party hardware software". Estridge IBM software development proprietary "out-VisiCalc VisiCorp out-Peachtree Peachtree—and that", IBM's version "Microsoft BASIC hundreds thousands users world. How going argue that?"Another advertisement told developers company consider publishing software "Education. Entertainment. Personal finance. Data management. Self-improvement. Games. Communications. And yes, business." Estridge explicitly invited small, "cottage" amateur professional developers create products "with", said, "our logo support". IBM sold PC discount employees, encouraged write software, distributed catalog inexpensive software written individuals appear public. Reaction BYTE correct predicting IBM personal computer receive public attention. Its rapid development amazed observers, willingness Colossus Armonk sell launch title Microsoft Adventure (a video game that, press release stated, brought "players fantasy caves treasures"); company offered optional joystick port. Future Computing estimated "IBM's Billion Dollar Baby" $2.3 billion hardware sales 1986. David Bunnell, editor Osborne/McGraw-Hill, recalled thatNone associates wanted talk Apple II Osborne I computer anymore, fantasize writing super-selling program ... All wanted talk IBM Personal Computer—what was, limitations, all, impact IBM business personal computing.Within weeks Bunnell helped PC Magazine, periodical computer.Competitors skeptical. Adam Osborne "when buy computer IBM, buy carte. By computer anything, cost Apple. I Apple worry about." Apple's Mike Markkula agreed IBM's product expensive Apple II, claimed Apple III "offers better performance". He denied IBM PC offered memory, stating company offer 128K "but frankly memory". Jon Shirley Tandy admitted IBM "legendary service reputation" claimed thousands Radio Shack stores "can better service", predicting IBM PC's "major market IBM addicts"; executive claimed Tandy undersell $3,000 IBM computer $1,000. Many criticized PC's design innovative outdated, believed alleged weaknesses, single-sided, single-density disks storage computer's RAM, existed company uncertain market experimenting releasing better computer. (Estridge boasted, "Many ... technologically machine. That best news had; set do.")Rivals Apple, Tandy, Commodore—together 50% personal-computer market—had advantages. While IBM began microcomputer, hardware software, couple dealers, Radio Shack 14 customers 8,000 stores—more McDonald's—that sold broad range computers accessories. Apple dealers US IBM, established international distribution network, installed base 250,000 customers. Hundreds independent developers produced software peripherals companies' computers; Apple databases processors available, PC databases processor. The computer limited graphics capability, customers wanted color high-quality text purchase graphics cards monitors.Steve Jobs Apple ordered team examine IBM PC. After finding unimpressive—Chris Espinosa called computer "a half-assed, hackneyed attempt"—the company confidently purchased full-page advertisement The Wall Street Journal headline "Welcome, IBM. Seriously". Microsoft head Bill Gates Apple headquarters day IBM's announcement "They care. It year realize happened". Success The IBM PC successful. BYTE reported rumor 40,000 ordered day announcement; John Dvorak recalled dealer day praised computer "incredible winner, IBM treat — Apple arrogance". One dealer received 22 $1,000 deposits customers promise delivery date. The company sold entire projected first-year production employees, IBM customers reluctant purchase Apples glad buy microcomputers traditional supplier. By October referred computer simply "PC".BYTE estimated 90% 40,000 first-day orders software developers. By COMDEX November Tecmar developed 20 products including memory expansion expansion chassis, surprising IBM. Jerry Pournelle reported attending West Coast Computer Faire 1982 IBM "encourages amateurs" "documents all", "an explosion [third-party] hardware software" visible convention. Many manufacturers professional business application software, planning/developing versions Apple II, switched efforts IBM PC announced. Often, products needed capacity speed hard-disk. Although IBM offer hard-disk option years introduction PC, business sales catalyzed simultaneous availability hard-disk subsystems, Tallgrass Technologies sold Computerland stores alongside IBM 5150 introduction 1981.Although IBM sold fewer 100,000 PCs year, PC World counted 753 software packages PC—more number Apple Macintosh year 1984 release—including 422 applications 200 utilities languages. InfoWorld reported "most major software houses frantically adapting programs PC", PC-specific developers composing "an entire subindustry formed PC's open system", Dvorak described "de facto standard microcomputer". The magazine estimated "hundreds tiny garage-shop operations" "bloodthirsty" competition sell peripherals, 30 40 companies price memory-expansion cards, example. PC Magazine renamed planned "1001 Products Use Your IBM PC" issue number product listings received exceeded figure. Tecmar companies benefited IBM's openness rapidly grew size importance, PC Magazine; years expanded 96 bimonthly 800 monthly pages, including 500 advertisements.By 1982 IBM selling PC minute business day. It estimated 50 70% PCs sold retail stores home, publicity selling popular product consumers caused IBM to, spokesman said, "enter world" familiarizing Colossus Armonk. Although PC provided three percent sales company underestimated demand 800%. Because prices based forecasts lower volume—250,000 years, PC IBM product—the PC profitable; company sold computers month. Estridge claimed 1983 October 1982 March 1983 customer demand quadrupled. He stated company increased production three year, warned component shortage demand continued increase.By mid-1983 Yankee Group estimated IBM PC-related products appeared day. In August 1983 Chess IBU, 4,000 employees, Entry Systems Division, observers believed indicated PC IBM overall, longer experiment. The PC surpassed Apple II best-selling personal computer 750,000 sold year, DEC sold 69,000 microcomputers months year despite offering three models markets. Retailers benefited, 65% BusinessLand's revenue PC. Demand exceeded supply years debut that, despite IBM shipping 40,000 PCs month, dealers reportedly received 60% desired quantity. Pournelle received PC paid July 1983 1 November, IBM Boca Raton employees neighbors wait weeks buy computers assembled there. Domination Yankee Group stated PC 1983 "destroyed market older machines" companies Vector Graphic, North Star, Cromemco. inCider wrote "This Apple magazine, let's kid ourselves, IBM devoured competitors cloud locusts". By February 1984 BYTE reported "the phenomenal market acceptance IBM PC", fall concluded company "has field third major standard, Apple II CP/M".By Apple welcoming rival inCider stated "godlike" reputation. Its focus III delayed improvements II, sophisticated Lisa unsuccessful because, II PC, Apple discouraged third-party developers. The head retail chain "It appears IBM better understanding Apple II Apple." Jobs, recruit Estridge Apple's president, admitted years IBM joined Apple "the industry's strongest competitors". He warned speech previewing forthcoming "1984" Super Bowl commercial: "It appears IBM ... Will Big Blue dominate entire computer industry? The entire age? Was George Orwell 1984?"IBM $4 billion annual PC revenue 1984, Apple sales Apple, Commodore, HP, Sperry combined, 6% total revenue. A Fortune survey 56% American companies personal computers IBM PCs, compared Apple's 16%. A 1983 study corporate customers thirds customers standardizing computer chose PC, compared 9% Apple. IBM's documentation described PC inferior competitors' less-expensive products, company generally compete price; rather, study preferred "IBM's hegemony" support. Most companies mainframes PCs larger computers, benefited IBM's mainframe sales discouraged purchasing non-IBM hardware.In 1984 IBM introduced PC/AT, predecessor sophisticated personal computer major company. By 1985 PC family doubled Future Computing's 1986 revenue estimate, 12,000 applications 4,500 dealers distributors worldwide. In obituary year, The New York Times wrote Estridge led "extraordinarily entry International Business Machines Corporation personal computer field". The Entry Systems Division 10,000 employees world's third-largest computer company IBM DEC, revenue IBM's minicomputer business despite start. IBM major company minicomputer microcomputer businesses, rivals DEC Wang adjust retail market.Rumors "lookalike", compatible computers, created IBM's approval, began IBM PC's release. Other manufacturers reverse engineered BIOS produce non-infringing functional copies. Columbia Data Products introduced IBM-PC compatible computer June 1982. In November 1982, Compaq Computer Corporation announced Compaq Portable, portable IBM PC compatible. The models shipped January 1983. IBM PC standard The IBM computer led companies develop IBM Compatibles, turn led branding diskettes advertised "IBM format". An IBM PC clone built off-the-shelf parts, BIOS required reverse engineering. Companies Compaq, Phoenix Software Associates, American Megatrends, Award, achieved functional versions BIOS, allowing companies Dell, Gateway HP manufacture PCs worked IBM's product. The IBM PC industry standard. Third-party distribution Because IBM retail experience, retail chains ComputerLand Sears Roebuck provided knowledge marketplace. They outlets product. More 190 Computerland stores existed, Sears process creating handful in-store computer centers sale product. This guaranteed IBM widespread distribution U.S.Targeting PC market, Sears Roebuck sales failed live expectations. This unfavorable outcome revealed strategy targeting office market higher sales. Models All IBM personal computers software backwards-compatible general, program work machine. Some programs sensitive speed class. Older programs advantage newer higher-resolution higher-color display standards, newer programs require newer display adapters. (Note display adapter adapter card IBM models, newer display hardware easily be, was, retrofitted older models.) A programs, typically ones, written require version IBM PC BIOS ROM. Most notably, BASICA dependent BIOS ROM sister program called GW-BASIC supported functions, 100% backwards compatible independently BIOS ROM. Original PC The CGA video card, suitable modulator, NTSC television set RGBi monitor display; IBM's RGBi monitor display model 5153. The option offered IBM MDA monochrome display model 5151. It install MDA CGA card monitors concurrently supported application program. For example, AutoCAD, Lotus 1-2-3 allowed CGA Monitor graphics separate monochrome monitor text menus. Some model 5150 PCs CGA monitors printer included MDA adapter default, IBM provided MDA printer adapter card; fact MDA/printer combo card.Although cassette tape originally envisioned IBM low-budget storage alternative, commonly medium floppy disk. The 5150 5-1/4" floppy drives drives program disc(s) drive A, drive B hold disc(s) working files; drive user swap program file discs single drive. For models drives storage medium, IBM intended users connect cassette recorder 5150's cassette socket. The cassette tape socket physically DIN plug keyboard socket it, electrically completely different.A disk installed 5150's system unit changing higher-rated power supply (although drives lower power consumption work standard 63.5 Watt unit). The "IBM 5161 Expansion Chassis" power supply 10 MB disk allowed installation second disk. The system unit expansion slots, expansion unit eight; however, system unit's slots expansion unit's slots occupied Extender Card Receiver Card, respectively, needed connect expansion unit system unit expansion unit's slots available, total 11 slots. A working configuration required slots occupied display, disk, I/O adapters, built 5150's motherboard; motherboard external connectors keyboard cassette ports.The simple PC speaker sound hardware board.The original PC's maximum memory IBM parts 256 kB, achievable installation 64 kB motherboard three 64 kB expansion cards. The processor Intel 8088 running 4.77 MHz, 4/3 standard NTSC color burst frequency 315/88 3.57954 MHz. (In units, Intel 8088 1978 version, 1978/81/2 versions Intel chip; second-sourced AMDs 1983). Some owners replaced 8088 NEC V20 increase processing speed support mode 80186 instructions. The V20 gained speed increase hardware multiplier 8088 lacked. An Intel 8087 co-processor hardware floating-point arithmetic.IBM sold IBM PCs configurations 16 64 kB RAM preinstalled thirty-six 16-kilobit DRAM chips. (The ninth bit parity checking memory.) After IBM XT shipped, IBM PC motherboard redesigned RAM configuration IBM XT. (64 kB bank, expandable 256kB populating 3 banks.)Although TV-compatible video board, cassette Federal Communications Commission Class B certification aimed making computer, original PC proved expensive market. At introduction, PC 64 kB RAM single 5.25-inch floppy drive monitor sold US $3,005 (equivalent $7,916 2016), cheapest configuration (US $1,565) floppy drives, 16 kB RAM, monitor (again, expectation users connect existing TV sets cassette recorders) proved unattractive low-spec, (cf. footnotes IBM PC range table). While 5150 selling computer, floppy-based configuration unexpectedly businesses. XT The "IBM Personal Computer XT", IBM model 5160, introduced years PC featured 10 megabyte drive. It expansion slots processor clock speed PC. The XT cassette jack, Cassette Basic interpreter ROMs.The XT 256 kB memory board (using 64 kbit DRAM); models expandable 640 kB. The remaining 384 kilobytes 8088 address space BIOS ROM, adapter ROM RAM space, including video RAM space. It sold Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) video card CGA video card.The expansion slots model 5150 spaced closer together. Although rare, card designed 5150 obstruct adjacent slot XT. Because spacing, XT motherboard fit case designed PC motherboard, slots peripheral cards compatible. The XT expansion bus (later called "8 bit Industry Standard Architecture" (ISA) competitors) retained IBM AT, connectors slots allow 16-bit transfers; 8 bit cards AT. XT/370 The "IBM Personal Computer XT/370" XT three custom 8-bit cards: processor card (370PC-P) contained modified Motorola 68000 chip, microcoded execute System/370 instructions, second 68000 handle bus arbitration memory transfers, modified 8087 emulate S/370 floating point instructions. The second card (370PC-M) connected contained 512 kB memory. The third card (PC3277-EM), 3270 terminal emulator install system software VM/PC software processors.The computer booted DOS, VM/PC Control Program. PCjr The "IBM PCjr" IBM's attempt enter market inexpensive educational home-use personal computers. The PCjr, IBM model number 4860, retained IBM PC's 8088 CPU BIOS interface compatibility, cost differences PCjr's architecture, well design implementation decisions, eventually led PCjr, IBM JX, commercial failures. Portable The "IBM Portable Personal Computer" 5155 model 68 portable computer developed IBM Compaq's suitcase-size portable machine (the Compaq Portable). It released February, 1984, eventually replaced IBM Convertible.The Portable XT motherboard, transplanted Compaq-style luggable case. The system featured 256 kilobytes memory (expandable 512 kB), CGA card connected internal monochrome (amber) composite monitor, half-height 5.25" 360K floppy disk drives. Unlike Compaq Portable, dual-mode monitor display card, IBM stock CGA board composite monitor, lower resolution. It however, display color connected external monitor television. AT The "IBM Personal Computer/AT" (model 5170), announced August 15, 1984, Intel 80286 processor, originally running 6 MHz. It 16-bit ISA bus 20 MB drive. A faster model, running 8 MHz sporting 30-megabyte disk introduced 1986.The AT designed support multitasking; SysRq (System request key), overlooked, design, 80286 itself, Intel 16-bit processor multitasking features (i.e. 80286 protected mode). IBM attempt marketing AT multi-user machine, sold faster PC power users. For part, IBM PC/ATs powerful DOS (single-tasking) personal computers, literal sense PC name.Early PC/ATs plagued reliability problems, software hardware incompatibilities, internal 20 MB disk, High Density Floppy Disk Drive.While people blamed IBM's disk controller card blamed disk manufacturer Computer Memories Inc. (CMI), IBM controller card worked fine drives, including CMI's 33-MB model. The problems introduced doubt computer and, while, 286 architecture general, IBM replaced 20 MB CMI drives, PC/AT proved reliable lasting industry standard.IBM AT's Drive parameter table listed CMI-33 615 cylinders 640 drive designed with, size 30 MB. Those re-used drives 616th cylinder bad landing area. AT/370 The "IBM Personal Computer AT/370" AT custom 16-bit cards, running exactly setup XT/370. Convertible The IBM PC Convertible, released April 3, 1986, IBM's laptop computer IBM computer utilize 3.5" floppy disk standard. Like modern laptops, featured power management ability batteries. It follow-up IBM Portable model number 5140. The concept design German industrial designer Richard Sapper.It utilized Intel 80c88 CPU (a CMOS version Intel 8088) running 4.77 MHz, 256 kB RAM (expandable 640 kB), dual 720 kB 3.5" floppy drives, monochrome CGA-compatible LCD screen price $2,000. It weighed 13 pounds (5.8 kg) featured built-in carrying handle.The PC Convertible expansion capabilities proprietary ISA bus-based rear machine. Extension modules, including small printer video output module, snapped place. The machine internal modem, room internal disk. Next-generation IBM PS/2 The IBM PS/2 introduced 1987. The Model 30 bottom lineup earlier models; 8086 processor ISA bus. The Model 30 "IBM compatible" standard 5.25-inch drive bays; 3.5-inch floppy drive optionally 3.5-inch-sized disk. Most models PS/2 departed "IBM compatible" replacing ISA bus completely Micro Channel Architecture. Technology Electronics The circuit board PC called motherboard (IBM terminology calls planar). This carries CPU RAM, bus slots expansion cards. On motherboard ROM subsystem, DMA IRQ controllers, coprocessor socket, sound (PC speaker, tone generation) circuitry, keyboard interface. The original PC cassette interface.The bus original PC popular, subsequently named ISA. While popular, commonly PC-bus XT-bus; term ISA arose industry leaders chose continue manufacturing machines based IBM PC AT architecture license PS/2 architecture MCA bus IBM. The XT-bus retroactively named 8-bit ISA XT ISA, unqualified term ISA refers 16-bit AT-bus (as better defined ISA specifications.) The AT-bus extension PC-/XT-bus day computers industrial use, speed, 5 volt signals, simple, straightforward design (all year 2011 standards) technical advantages (e.g. noise immunity reliability).A monitor floppy disk drives connected motherboard cables connected graphics adapter disk controller cards, respectively, installed expansion slots. Each expansion slot motherboard corresponding opening computer case card expose connectors; blank metal cover plate covers case opening (to prevent dust debris intrusion control airflow) expansion card installed. Memory expansion amount installable motherboard boards installed expansion slots, I/O devices parallel, serial, network ports likewise installed individual expansion boards. For reason, easy fill expansion slots PC, slots XT, installing hardware. Companies Quadram AST addressed popular multi-I/O cards combine peripherals adapter card slot; Quadram offered QuadBoard AST SixPak.Intel 8086 8088-based PCs require expanded memory (EMS) boards work 640 kB memory. (Though 8088 address megabyte memory, 384 kB reserved BIOS ROM, BASIC ROM, extension ROMs installed adapter cards, memory address space devices including display adapter RAM 64 kB EMS frame itself.) The original IBM PC AT Intel 80286 processor access 16 MB memory (though standard DOS applications megabyte additional APIs.) Intel 80286-based computers running OS/2 work maximum memory. Peripheral integrated circuits The set peripheral chips selected original IBM PC defined functionality IBM compatible. These facto base application integrated circuits (ASICs) compatible products.The original system chips Intel 8259 programmable interrupt controller (PIC) (at I/O address 0x20), Intel 8237 direct memory access (DMA) controller (at I/O address 0x00), Intel 8253 programmable interval timer (PIT) (at I/O address 0x40). The PIT 18.2 Hz clock ticks, dynamic memory refresh timing, speaker output; DMA channel perform memory refresh.The mathematics coprocessor Intel 8087 I/O address 0xF0. This option users needed extensive floating-point arithmetic, users computer-aided drafting.The IBM PC AT second, slave 8259 PIC (at I/O address 0xA0), second 8237 DMA controller 16-bit DMA (at I/O address 0xC0), DMA address register (implemented 74LS612 IC) (at I/O address 0x80), Motorola MC146818 real-time clock (RTC) nonvolatile memory (NVRAM) system configuration (replacing DIP switches jumpers purpose PC PC/XT models (at I/O address 0x70). On expansion cards, Intel 8255 programmable peripheral interface (PPI) (at I/O addresses 0x378 parallel I/O controls printer, 8250 universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) (at I/O address 0x3F8 0x3E8) controls serial communication (pseudo-) RS-232 port. Joystick IBM offered Game Control Adapter PC, supported analog joysticks Apple II. Although analog controls proved inferior arcade-style games, asset genres flight simulators. The joystick IBM PC supported controllers, required Y-splitter cable connect once. It remained standard joystick interface IBM compatibles replaced USB 2000s. Keyboard The keyboard IBM 5150 extremely reliable high-quality electronic keyboard originally developed North Carolina Datamaster. Each rated reliable 100 keystrokes. For IBM PC, separate keyboard housing designed novel usability feature allowed users adjust keyboard angle personal comfort. Compared keyboards small computers time, IBM PC keyboard superior played role establishing high-quality impression. For example, industrial design adjustable keyboard, system unit, recognized major design award. Byte magazine fall 1981 keyboard 50% reason buy IBM PC. The keyboard definitely established 1983 IBM PCjr flopped, mediocre Chiclet keyboard impression customers. Oddly enough, happened original IBM PC 1981 management seriously considered substituting cheaper lower quality keyboard. This mistake narrowly avoided advice original development engineers.However, original 1981 IBM PC 83-key keyboard criticized typists non-standard placement Return left ⇧ Shift keys, separate cursor numeric pads popular pre-PC DEC VT100 series video terminals. In 1982, Key Tronic introduced standard 101-key PC keyboard. In 1984, IBM corrected Return left ⇧ Shift AT keyboard, shortened Backspace key, making harder reach. In 1986, IBM changed 101 enhanced keyboard, separate cursor numeric pads, relocated function Ctrl keys, Esc relocated opposite keyboard.Another feature original keyboard loud "click" sound pressed. Since typewriter users accustomed keeping eyes hardcopy typing mechanical sound character typed paper ensure pressed (and once), PC keyboard keyswitch produced click tactile bump intended reassurance.The IBM PC keyboard robust flexible. The low-level interface same: sends signal pressed signal released. An integrated microcontroller keyboard scans keyboard encodes "scan code" "release code" pressed released separately. Any shift key, number held simultaneously separately sensed. The controller keyboard handles typematic operation, issuing periodic repeat scan codes depressed single release code finally released.An "IBM PC compatible" keyboard recognize combination true IBM PC does, shifted cursor keys. In addition, "compatible" vendors proprietary keyboard interfaces, preventing keyboard replaced.Although PC/XT AT style keyboard connector, low-level protocol reading keyboard series. The AT keyboard bidirectional interface allows computer send commands keyboard. An AT keyboard XT, reverse. Third-party keyboard manufacturers provided switch keyboards select AT-style XT-style protocol keyboard. Character set The original IBM PC 7-bit ASCII alphabet basis, extended 8 bits nonstandard character codes. This character set suitable international applications, veritable cottage industry emerged providing variants original character set national variants. In IBM tradition, variants called code pages. These codings obsolete, replaced systematic standardized forms character coding, ISO 8859-1, Windows-1251 Unicode. The original character set code 437. Storage Cassette tape IBM equipped model 5150 cassette connecting cassette drive assumed users purchase low-end model save files cassette tapes typical computers time. However, adoption floppy- monitor-less configuration low; (if any) IBM PCs left factory floppy disk drive installed. Also, DOS cassette tape, floppy disks (hence "Disk Operating System"). 5150s external cassette recorders storage built-in ROM BASIC operating system. As DOS increasing adoption, incompatibility DOS programs PCs cassettes storage configuration attractive. The ROM BIOS supported cassette operations.The IBM PC cassette interface encodes data frequency modulation variable data rate. Either represented single cycle square wave, square wave frequencies factor two, lower frequency. Therefore, bit periods zeros factor two, unusual data stream zeros tape (and time) equal-length (in bits) data stream zeros, equal numbers each.IBM exclusive license agreement Microsoft include BASIC ROM PC; clone manufacturers ROM BASIC machines, problem XT, AT, PS/2 eliminated cassette IBM required install (now useless) BASIC them. The agreement finally expired 1991 Microsoft replaced BASICA/GW-BASIC QBASIC. The core BASIC resided ROM "linked" RAM-resident BASIC.COM/BASICA.COM included PC-DOS (they provided disk support extended features ROM BASIC). Because BASIC 50 kB size, served function three years PC machines 64 -128 kB memory, 1985. For comparison, clone makers Compaq forced include version BASIC resided entirely RAM. Floppy diskettes Most 5150 PCs 5.25-inch floppy disk drives. These single-sided double-density (SSDD) double-sided double-density (DSDD) drives. The IBM PC single density floppy drives. The drives disks commonly referred capacity, "160KB floppy disk" "360KB floppy drive". DSDD drives backwards compatible; write SSDD floppies. The type physical diskette drives, disk formatted double-sided single-sided drive.The disks Modified Frequency Modulation (MFM) coded 512-byte sectors, soft-sectored. They contained 40 tracks 48 track inch (TPI) density, initially formatted sectors track. This SSDD disks initially formatted capacity 160 kB, DSDD disks capacity 320 kB. However, DOS operating system updated allow formatting disks sectors track. This yielded formatted capacity 180 kB SSDD disks/drives, 360 kB DSDD disks/drives. The unformatted capacity floppy disks advertised "250KB" SSDD "500KB" DSDD ("KB" ambiguously referring 1000 1024 bytes; essentially rounded-off values), "raw" 250/500 kB usable formatted capacity; DOS, maximum capacity SSDD DSDD disks 180 kB 360 kB, respectively. Regardless type, file system floppy disks (under DOS) FAT12.The earliest IBM PCs single-sided floppy drives double-sided drives spring 1982. After upgraded 64k-256k motherboard PCs arrived 1983, single-sided drives cassette model discontinued.IBM's original floppy disk controller card included external 37-pin D-shell connector. This allowed users connect additional external floppy drives third party vendors, IBM offer external floppies 1986.The industry-standard setting floppy drive numbers setting jumper switches drive unit, IBM chose method "cable twist" floppy data cable bend middle served switch drive motor control. This eliminated users adjust jumpers installing floppy drive. Fixed disks The 5150 power drives retrofitting stronger power supply, IBM offered 5161 Expansion Unit, provided expansion slots, included 10 MB (later 20 MB) drive powered 5161's separate 130-watt power supply. The IBM 5161 Expansion Unit released 1983.During year IBM PC, commonplace users install third-party Winchester disks generally connected floppy controller required patched version PC-DOS treated giant floppy disk (there subdirectory support).IBM began offering disks XT, original PC sold them. Nonetheless, users installed disks upgraded power supplies them.After floppy disks obsolete 2000s, letters A B unused. But 25 years, virtually DOS-based PC software assumed program installation drive C, primary HDD continues "the C drive" today. Other operating system families (e.g. Unix) bound designations. OS support Which operating system IBM customers choose unclear. Although company expected PC DOS IBM supported CP/M-86—which months DOS—or UCSD p-System operating systems. IBM promised favor operating system others; CP/M-86 support surprised Gates, claimed IBM "blackmailed it". IBM correct, nonetheless, expectation; survey 96.3% PCs ordered $40 DOS compared 3.4% $240 CP/M-86.The IBM PC's ROM BASIC BIOS supported cassette tape storage. PC DOS support cassette tape storage. PC DOS version 1.00 supported 160 kB SSDD floppies, version 1.1, released months PC's introduction, supported 160 kB SSDD 320 kB DSDD floppies. Support larger sector track 180 kB 360 kB formats arrived 10 months March 1983. BIOS The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) provided core ROM code PC. It contained library functions software basic tasks video output, keyboard input, disk access addition interrupt handling, loading operating system boot-up, testing memory system components.The original IBM PC BIOS 8k size occupied 2k ROM chips motherboard, sixth empty slot left extra ROMs user wished install. IBM offered three BIOS revisions PC's lifespan. The initial BIOS dated April 1981 earliest models single-sided floppy drives PC DOS 1.00. The second version dated October 1981 arrived "Revision B" models sold double-sided drives PC DOS 1.10. It corrected bugs, unchanged. Finally, third BIOS version dated October 1982 IBM PCs newer 64k-256k motherboard. This revision more-or-less identical XT's BIOS. It support detecting ROMs expansion cards well ability 640k memory (the earlier BIOS revisions limit 544k). Unlike XT, original PC remained functionally unchanged 1983 discontinuation 1987 support 101-key keyboards 3.5" floppy drives, offered half-height floppies. Video output IBM initially offered video adapters PC, Color/Graphics Adapter Monochrome Display Printer Adapter. CGA intended typical computer display; NTSC output connected composite monitor TV set RF modulator addition RGB digital RGBI-type monitors, IBM offer RGB monitor 1983. Supported graphics modes 40 80x25 color text 8x8 character resolution, 320x200 bitmap graphics fixed 4-color palettes, 640x200 monochrome graphics.The MDA card companion 5151 monitor supported 80x25 text 9x14 character resolution (total pixel resolution 720x350). It intended business market included printer port.During 1982, third-party video card PC appeared Hercules Computer Technologies released clone MDA bitmap graphics. Although supported BIOS, Hercules Graphics Adapter extremely popular business allowing sharp, high resolution graphics text cloned manufacturers.In 1985, launch IBM AT, Enhanced Graphics Adapter support 320x200 640x200 16 colors addition high-resolution 640x350 16 color graphics.IBM offered video board PC, XT, AT Professional Graphics Adapter 1984-86, intended CAD design. It extremely expensive, required monitor, rarely ordered customers.VGA graphics cards installed IBM PCs XTs, introduced computer's discontinuation. Serial addresses interrupts The serial 8250 derivative (such 16450 16550), mapped consecutive IO addresses interrupt request line.Only COM1: COM2: addresses defined original PC. Attempts share IRQ3 IRQ4 additional ports require measures hardware software, shared IRQs defined original PC design. The typical devices plugged serial modems mice. Plotters serial printers commonly serial peripherals, numerous unusual operating cash registers, factory equipment, connecting terminals. Printer IBM deal Japan-based Epson produce printers PC IBM-branded printers manufactured company (Epson course sold printers name). There considerable amount controversy IBM included printer PC industry-standard Centronics design, rumored prevent customers non-Epson/IBM printers machines (plugging Centronics printer IBM PC damage printer, parallel port, both). Although third-party cards Centronics ports them, PC clones copied IBM printer 80s, displaced Centronics standard. Reception BYTE wrote October 1981 IBM PC's "hardware impressive, striking decisions IBM: suppliers established microcomputer industry, assistance independent, small-scale software writers manufacturers peripheral devices". It praised "smart" hardware design stated price higher 8-bit machines Apple others. The reviewer admitted computer "came shock. I expected giant stumble overestimating underestimating capabilities public stubbornly insisting incompatibility rest microcomputer world. But IBM stumble all; instead, giant jumped leagues front competition ... disappointment IBM Personal Computer dull name".In detailed review January 1982, BYTE called IBM PC "a synthesis best microcomputer industry offered ... well designed inside outside". The magazine praised keyboard "bar none, best ... microcomputer", describing unusual Shift locations "minor [problems] compared gigantic mistakes microcomputer keyboard". The review complimented IBM's manuals, predicted "will set standard microcomputer documentation future. Not well packaged, well organized, easy understand, complete". Observing detailed technical "much earlier ... machines", magazine predicted "given reasonable period time, plenty hardware software developed for" computer. The review stated IBM PC cost comparably configured Apple II TRS-80 computers, insufficient number slots desirable expansion cards serious weakness, "you lot money" concluded, "In years so, I [it] popular best-supported ... IBM people designed it".In 1984 issue dedicated IBM PC, BYTE concluded PC succeeded features 80-column screen, open architecture, high-quality keyboard, "the failure major companies fundamental features earlier. In retrospect, IBM stepped void remained, paradoxically, center crowded market". Longevity Many IBM PCs remained service technology obsolete. In June 2006, IBM PC XT models majority U.S. National Weather Service upper-air observing sites, process data returned ascending radiosonde, attached weather balloon, slowly phased out. Factors contributed 5150 PC's longevity flexible modular design, open technical standard (making needed adapt, modify, repair available), nonstandard parts, rugged high-standard IBM manufacturing, provided exceptional long-term reliability durability.Some mechanical aspects slot specifications current PCs. A systems PS/2 style keyboard mouse connectors. Collectability The IBM model 5150 Personal Computer collectable vintage computer collectors, system true “PC” today. Today systems fetch $100 $4500, depending cosmetic operational condition. The IBM model 5150 proven reliable; despite 30 years more, function new.

IBM PC compatible computers original IBM PC, XT, AT, software support expansion cards those. Such computers referred PC clones, IBM clones. They duplicate exactly features PC architecture, facilitated IBM's choice commodity hardware components manufacturers' ability reverse engineer BIOS firmware "clean room design" technique. Columbia Data Products built clone IBM personal computer clean room implementation BIOS.Early IBM PC compatibles computer bus original PC AT models. The IBM AT compatible bus named Industry Standard Architecture bus manufacturers compatible computers. The term "IBM PC compatible" historical description only, IBM ended personal computer sales.Descendants IBM PC compatibles comprise majority personal computers market presently operating system Microsoft Windows, interoperability bus structure peripherals original PC architecture limited non-existent. Only Macintosh (classic Mac OS macOS) market share compatibility IBM PC, consumers typically identified "PC Mac" user (similar divide mobile devices Android iOS). Origins IBM decided 1980 market low-cost single-user computer response Apple Computer's burgeoning microcomputer market. On 12 August 1981, IBM PC sale. There three operating systems (OS) it. The expensive popular PC DOS Microsoft. In crucial concession, IBM's agreement allowed Microsoft sell version, MS-DOS, non-IBM computers. The component original PC architecture exclusive IBM BIOS (Basic Input/Output System).IBM asked developers avoid writing software addressed computer's hardware directly, standard calls BIOS functions carried hardware-dependent operations. This software machine MS-DOS PC-DOS. Software directly addressed hardware making standard calls faster, however; relevant games. Software addressing IBM PC hardware MS-DOS machines hardware. The IBM PC sold high volumes justify writing software it, encouraged manufacturers produce machines programs, expansion cards, peripherals PC. The 808x computer marketplace rapidly excluded machines hardware- software-compatible PC. The 640 KB barrier "conventional" system memory MS-DOS legacy period; non-clone machines, subject limit, exceed 640 kB.Rumors "lookalike", compatible computers, created IBM's approval, began IBM PC's release. By June 1983 PC Magazine defined "PC 'clone'" "a computer [that can] accommodate user takes disk IBM PC, walks room, plugs 'foreign' machine". Because shortage IBM PCs year, customers purchased clones instead. Columbia Data Products produced computer compatible IBM PC standard June 1982, Eagle Computer. Compaq announced IBM PC compatible November 1982, Compaq Portable. The Compaq sewing machine-sized portable computer essentially 100% PC-compatible. The company copy BIOS directly court decision Apple v. Franklin, reverse-engineer IBM BIOS write BIOS clean room design. Compatibility issues Non-compatible MS-DOS computers At time, manufacturers Tandy/RadioShack, Xerox, Hewlett-Packard, Digital Equipment Corporation, Sanyo, Texas Instruments, Tulip, Wang Olivetti introduced personal computers supported MS DOS, completely software- hardware-compatible IBM PC.Like IBM, Microsoft's intention application writers write application programming interfaces MS-DOS firmware BIOS, termed hardware abstraction layer. Each computer Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) version MS-DOS, customized hardware. Any software written MS-DOS operate MS-DOS computer, despite variations hardware design.This expectation reasonable computer marketplace time. Until Microsoft based computer languages BASIC. The established small system operating software CP/M Digital Research hobbyist level professional microcomputers. To achieve widespread use, product viable economically, OS operate range machines vendors varying hardware. Those customers needed applications starter programs reasonably expect publishers offer products variety computers, suitable each.Microsoft's competing OS intended initially operate varied spectrum hardware, based 8086 processor. Thus, MS-DOS years sold OEM product. There Microsoft-branded MS-DOS: MS-DOS purchased directly Microsoft, OEM release packaged trade dress PC vendor. Malfunctions reported OEM, Microsoft. However, machines compatible IBM hardware—thus supporting direct calls hardware—became widespread, clear OEM versions MS-DOS virtually identical, provision utility programs.MS-DOS provided adequate functionality character-oriented applications implemented text-only terminal. Had bulk commercially software nature, low-level hardware compatibility mattered. However, order maximum performance leverage hardware features (or work hardware bugs), PC applications developed simple terminal applications MS-DOS supported directly. Spreadsheets, WYSIWYG processors, presentation software remote communication software established markets exploited PC's strengths, required capabilities MS-DOS provided. Thus, development MS-DOS software environment, commercial software products written directly hardware, variety reasons:MS-DOS position text cursor advance displaying letter (teletype mode). While BIOS video interface routines adequate rudimentary output, efficient direct hardware addressing, extra processing; "string" output, character-by-character teletype output, inserted delays prevent CGA hardware "snow" (a display artifact CGA cards produced writing directly screen memory)——an bad artifact called IRQs, making multitasking difficult. A program wrote directly video memory achieve output rates 5 20 faster making system calls. Turbo Pascal technique earliest versions.Graphics capability seriously original IBM design brief; graphics considered perspective generating static business graphics charts graphs. MS-DOS API graphics, BIOS included rudimentary graphics functions changing screen modes plotting single points. To BIOS point drawn modified increased overhead considerably, making BIOS interface notoriously slow. Because this, line-drawing, arc-drawing, blitting performed application achieve acceptable speed, bypassing BIOS accessing video memory directly. Software written address IBM PC hardware directly IBM clone, rewritten non-PC-compatible MS-DOS machine.Video games, ones, required true graphics mode. They performed machine-dependent trick programmers order speed. Though initially major market PC business applications, games capability factor motivating PC purchases prices decreased. The availability quality games difference purchase PC compatible platform ability exchange data Amiga.Communications software directly accessed UART serial chip, MS-DOS API BIOS support slow hardware transfer data 19,200 bit/s.Even standard business applications, speed execution competitive advantage. Integrated software Context MBA preceded Lotus 1-2-3 market included functions. Context MBA written UCSD p-System, making portable slow usable PC. 1-2-3 written x86 assembly language performed machine-dependent tricks. It faster surpassed Context MBA's sales.Disk copy-protection schemes, common time, worked reading nonstandard data patterns diskette verify originality. These patterns impossible detect standard DOS BIOS calls, direct access disk controller hardware protection work.Some software designed true IBM PC, checked IBM BIOS. Difficulty "Operationally Compatible" In May 1983, Future Computing defined levels compatibility:Operationally Compatible. Can "the selling" IBM PC software, PC expansion boards, write PC disks. Has "complementary features" portability lower price distinguish computer PC, sold store. Examples: (Best) Columbia Data Products, Compaq; (Better) Corona; (Good) Eagle.Functionally Compatible. Runs version popular PC software. Cannot PC expansion boards write PC disks. Cannot Operationally Compatible. Example: TI Professional.Data Compatible. May PC software. Can and/or write PC disks. Can Functionally Compatible. Examples: NCR Decision Mate, Olivetti M20, Wang PC, Zenith Z-100.Incompatible. Cannot PC disks. Can Data Compatible. Examples: Altos 586, DEC Rainbow 100, Grid Compass, Victor 9000.During development, Compaq engineers Microsoft Flight Simulator subLOGIC's Bruce Artwick described "a bug Intel's chips", forcing computer bug compatible IBM PC. At first, clones Compaq's offered compatibility; Columbia University reported January 1984, example, Kermit modification Compaq Columbia Data Products clones, Eagle Seequa. Other MS-DOS computers required custom code.When PC Magazine requested samples computer manufacturers claimed produce PC compatibles April 1984 review, 14 31 declined. Corona Data Systems "Our systems software conforms IBM PC programming standards. And popular software does." When BYTE journalist asked test Peachtext Spring 1983 COMDEX, Corona representatives "hemmed hawed bit, finally led ... corner fail". The magazine reported "Their hesitancy unnecessary. The disk booted problem".Creative Computing 1985 stated, "we reiterate standard IBM PC compatibles: package buy computer." Companies modified computers' BIOS work newly discovered incompatible applications, reviewers users developed stress tests measure compatibility; 1984 ability operate Lotus 1-2-3 Flight Simulator standard.IBM believed companies Eagle, Corona, Handwell infringed copyright, Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp. forced clone makers BIOS. The Phoenix BIOS 1984, however, products AMI BIOS, permitted computer makers legally build essentially 100%-compatible clones reverse-engineer PC BIOS themselves. A September 1985 InfoWorld chart listed compatibles 256 KB RAM, disk drives, monochrome monitors $1,495 $2,320, equivalent IBM PC cost $2,820. The decreasing influence IBM In February 1984 Byte wrote "IBM's burgeoning influence PC community stifling innovation companies mimicking Big Blue", market grew IBM's influence diminished. In November 1985 PC Magazine stated "Now created [PC] market, market IBM machines. It depend IBM set standards develop higher-performance machines, IBM better conform existing standards hurt users". In January 1987 Bruce Webster wrote Byte rumors IBM introduce proprietary personal computers proprietary operating system: "Who cares? If IBM it, isolate largest marketplace, compete anyway". The magazine predicted 1987 market "will complete transition IBM standard Intel/MS-DOS/expansion bus standard ... Folks aren't concerned IBM compatibility Lotus 1-2-3 compatibility".After IBM announced OS/2-oriented PS/2 1987, sales existing DOS-compatible PC compatibles rose, proprietary operating system available. In 1988 Gartner Group estimated public purchased 1.5 clones IBM PC. By 1989 Compaq influential industry executives spoke "Compaq compatible", observers stating customers company IBM's equal.After 1987, IBM PC compatibles dominated business markets commodity computers, notable alternative architectures niche markets, Macintosh computers offered Apple Inc. desktop publishing time, aging 8-bit Commodore 64 selling $150 world's best-selling computer, 32-bit Commodore Amiga television video production 32-bit Atari ST music industry. However, IBM lost role market IBM PC compatibles 1990. A events retrospect important:The 1982 introduction Compaq Portable, 100% IBM PC compatible computer, providing portability unavailable IBM time.An Independent Business Unit (IBU) IBM developed IBM PC XT. IBUs share corporate R&D expense. After IBU Entry Systems Division lost benefit, greatly decreasing margins.The availability 1986 sub-$1000 "Turbo XT" PC XT compatibles, including offerings Dell Computer, reducing demand IBM's models. It buy "generic" systems cost IBM-branded PC AT, companies that.Compaq beating IBM market 1986 Compaq Deskpro 386, 80386-based PC.IBM's 1987 introduction incompatible proprietary MicroChannel Architecture (MCA) computer bus, Personal System/2 (PS/2) line.The 1988 introduction "Gang Nine" companies rival bus, Extended Industry Standard Architecture, intended compete with, copy, MCA.The duelling expanded memory (EMS) extended memory (XMS) standards 1980s, developed input IBM.Despite popularity ThinkPad set laptop PC's, IBM finally relinquished role PC manufacturer April 2005, sold consumer PC division Lenovo US$1.75 billion.As October 2007, Hewlett-Packard Dell largest shares PC market North America. They overseas, Acer, Lenovo, Toshiba notable. Worldwide, huge number PCs "white box" systems assembled myriad local systems builders. Despite advances computer technology, current IBM PC compatibles remain compatible original IBM PC computers, components implement compatibility backward compatibility modes system boot. It practical software modern system emulator relying features. Expandability One strengths PC compatible design modular hardware design. End-users upgrade peripherals and, degree, processor memory modifying computer's motherboard replacing computer, case microcomputers time. However, processor speed memory width increased, limits original XT/AT bus design reached, driving graphics video cards. IBM introduce upgraded bus IBM PS/2 computer overcame technical limits XT/AT bus, rarely basis IBM compatible computers required licence payments IBM PS/2 bus prior AT-bus designs produced company seeking license. This unpopular hardware manufacturers competing bus standards developed consortiums, agreeable license terms. Various attempts standardize interfaces made, practice, attempts flawed ignored. Even so, expansion options, despite confusion users, PC compatible design advanced faster competing designs time, market dominance. "IBM PC compatible" "Wintel" During 1990s, IBM's influence PC architecture started decline. An IBM-brand PC exception rule. Instead placing compatibility IBM PC, vendors began emphasize compatibility Windows. In 1993, version Windows NT released operate processors x86 set. While required applications recompiled, developers do, hardware independence Silicon Graphics (SGI) x86 workstations–thanks NT's Hardware abstraction layer (HAL), operate NT (and vast application library).No mass-market personal computer hardware vendor dared incompatible latest version Windows, Microsoft's annual WinHEC conferences provided setting Microsoft lobby for—and cases dictate—the pace direction hardware PC industry. Microsoft Intel ongoing development PC hardware industry writers began Wintel refer combined hardware-software system.This terminology misnomer, Intel lost absolute control direction x86 hardware development AMD's AMD64. Also, non-Windows operating systems macOS Linux established presence x86 architecture. Design limitations compatibility issues Although IBM PC designed expandability, designers anticipate hardware developments 1980s, size industry engender. To things worse, IBM's choice Intel 8088 CPU introduced limitations developing software PC compatible platform. For example, 8088 processor 20-bit memory addressing space. To expand PCs megabyte, Lotus, Intel, Microsoft jointly created expanded memory (EMS), bank-switching scheme allow memory provided add-in hardware, accessed set 16-Kilobyte "windows" inside 20-bit addressing. Later, Intel CPUs larger address spaces directly address 16- megabytes (MiBs) (80286) more, causing Microsoft develop extended memory (XMS) require additional hardware."Expanded" "extended" memory incompatible interfaces, writing software megabyte systems greatest compatibility MS-DOS began including EMM386, simulated EMS memory XMS memory. A protected mode OS written 80286, DOS application compatibility difficult expected, DOS applications accessed hardware directly, bypassing BIOS routines intended ensure compatibility, BIOS requests 32 interrupt vectors, marked "reserved" protected mode processor exceptions Intel.Video cards suffered incompatibilities. Once video cards advanced SVGA standard accessing longer clear. At time, PC programming memory model 64 KB memory segments. The common VGA graphics mode's screen memory fit single memory segment. SVGA modes required memory, accessing screen memory tricky. Each manufacturer developed methods accessing screen memory, going number modes consistently. An attempt creating standard named VESA BIOS Extensions (VBE) made, manufacturers it.When 386 introduced, protected mode OS written it. This time, DOS compatibility easier virtual 8086 mode. Unfortunately programs switch directly them, eventually, memory-model APIs developed, VCPI DPMI, popular.Because great number third-party adapters standard them, programming PC difficult. Professional developers operate test-suite known-to-be-popular hardware combinations.Meanwhile, consumers overwhelmed competing, incompatible standards combinations hardware offer. To idea sort PC operate software, Multimedia PC (MPC) standard set 1990. A PC minimum MPC standard marketed MPC logo, consumers easy-to-understand specification for. Software operate minimally MPC-compliant PC guaranteed operate MPC. The MPC level 2 MPC level 3 standards set later, term "MPC compliant" popular. After MPC level 3 1996, MPC standards established. Challenges Wintel domination By 1990s, Microsoft Windows, partially Microsoft's questionable business practices, driven rival commercial operating systems near-extinction, ensured “IBM PC compatible” computer computing platform. This developer software Wintel platform, reach vast majority computer users. By 1980s, major competitor Windows percentage points market share Apple Inc.'s Macintosh. The Mac started billed "the computer rest us" Mac's high prices closed architecture DOS/Windows onslaught drove Macintosh education desktop publishing niche, emerged mid-2000s. By mid-1990s Mac's market share dwindled 5% introducing rival operating system risky commercial venture. Experience operating system technically superior Windows, failure market fall victim Microsoft's illegal tactics (BeOS OS/2 example). In 1989 Steve Jobs NeXT system, "It hardware platform succeed, fail." Four years 1993 NeXT announced production NeXTcube porting NeXTSTEP Intel processors.Very PC history, companies introduced XT-compatible chipsets. For example, Chips Technologies introduced 82C100 XT Controller integrated replaced original XT circuits: 8237 DMA controller, 8253 interrupt timer, 8255 parallel interface controller, 8259 interrupt controller, 8284 clock generator, 8288 bus controller. Similar non-Intel chipsets appeared AT-compatibles, example OPTi's 82C206 82C495XLC 486 Pentium systems. The x86 chipset market volatile though. In 1993, VLSI Technology market player virtually wiped Intel year later. Intel uncontested leader since. As "Wintel" platform gained dominance Intel gradually abandoned practice licensing technologies chipset makers; 2010 Intel involved litigation refusal license processor bus technologies companies Nvidia.Companies AMD Cyrix developed alternative CPUs functionally compatible Intel's. Towards 1990s, AMD increasing share CPU market PCs. AMD ended playing role directing development x86 platform Athlon processors continued develop classic x86 architecture Intel deviated Netburst architecture Pentium 4 CPUs IA-64 architecture Itanium set server CPUs. AMD developed AMD64, major extension created Intel, Intel x86-64. During 2006 Intel began abandoning Netburst release set "Core" processors represented development earlier Pentium III.A major alternative Wintel domination mobile computing 2000s, marked start post-PC era. By mid-2016, Windows-running PCs half market share computers; "IBM PC" compatibles additional macOS-running computers, capable running Windows, "PCs" point majority. Mobile computers, running Android iOS – Tablets smartphones – based CPUs ARM architecture – represent bulk personal computers "PCs", sense, "IBM PC compatible" sense. A version Windows, Windows RT (that discontinued, versions; Windows 10 supporting x86 also), exists ARM-based computers. The IBM PC compatible today The term "IBM PC compatible" commonly presently current mainstream desktop laptop computers based PC architecture, IBM longer PCs. The competing hardware architectures discontinued or, Amiga, relegated niche, enthusiast markets. In past, exception Apple's Macintosh platform, non-Intel processors inception. Although Macintosh initially based Motorola 68000 family, transitioned PowerPC architecture, Macintosh computers transitioned Intel processors 2006. Today's Macintosh computers share system architecture Wintel counterparts boot Microsoft Windows delegating DOS Compatibility Card.The processor speed memory capacity modern PCs orders magnitude greater original IBM PC backwards compatibility maintained – 32-bit operating system released 2000s operate simpler programs written OS 1980s needing emulator, emulator DOSBox near-native functionality speed. Additionally, modern PCs DOS directly, options USB legacy mode SATA-to-PATA emulation set BIOS setup utility. Computers Extensible Firmware Interface set legacy BIOS mode boot DOS. However, BIOS/EFI options mass-produced consumer-grade computers limited configured handle OSes original variants DOS.The spread x86-64 architecture distanced current computers' operating systems' internal similarity original IBM PC introducing processor mode instruction set modified 64-bit addressing, x86-64 capable processors retain standard x86 compatibility. Intel started making x86 CPUs (Intel Atom) Android, slow start tablet computers smartphones. Now Google supports x86 equally Android uses. x86 Android hardware theoretically IBM PC compatible practical running Windows driver support lack mouse keyboard (although USB On-The-Go Bluetooth supply these).
